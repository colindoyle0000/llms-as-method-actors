You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

LADY, SUE, EARLY, BIG

When combined with the word "Bird," each word forms a well-known name or phrase: "Lady Bird," "Sue Bird," "Early Bird," and "Big Bird." These refer respectively to Lady Bird Johnson (former First Lady), Sue Bird (professional basketball player), the proverb "The early bird gets the worm," and Big Bird (a character from Sesame Street)./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
