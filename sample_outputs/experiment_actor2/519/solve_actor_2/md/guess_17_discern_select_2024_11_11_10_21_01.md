You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 The following guesses were incorrect: 
CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS


Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully evaluate the notes and the words provided to determine if there is a strong guess to submit.

1. **Incorrect Guess**: CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS
   - This combination was already tried and found to be incorrect, so we should avoid any guess that includes all four of these words together.

2. **Brainstorming Note #3**:
   - **Solution**: MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, CORE
   - **Explanation**: These words are connected by the idea of being the main part or essence of something. They are each a kind of "essence" or "central part."

3. **Brainstorming Note #4**:
   - **Solution**: SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE
   - **Explanation**: These words can be synonymous in the sense of "core" or "essence." However, a fourth word was not identified in this note.

Given the notes, the strongest viable guess is from Brainstorming Note #3: MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, CORE. This guess includes four words that are all connected by the idea of being the main part or essence of something, and it does not repeat the incorrect guess.

Therefore, the top choice for a guess to submit is: **MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, CORE**.

Let's submit this guess as it seems to be the strongest option based on the notes provided./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
