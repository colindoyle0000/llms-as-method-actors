Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words are each a type of the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each a type of name prefix: GEN MS PROF REV
Puzzle words that are each a type of road name: ALLEY DRIVE LANE STREET
Puzzle words that are each a type of interval of time: PERIOD SPELL STRETCH WHILE
Puzzle words that are each a type of farm tool: HOE PLOW RAKE SICKLE
Puzzle words that are each a type of sports venue: ARENA BOWL DOME FIELD
Puzzle words that are each a type of murky condition: CLOUD FOG HAZE MIST
Puzzle words that are each a type of luxurious fabric: CHIFFON SATIN SILK VELVET
Puzzle words that are each a type of ice cream treat: FLOAT SHAKE SPLIT SUNDAE
Puzzle words that are each a type of hardware fastener: BOLT NAIL RIVET SCREW
Puzzle words that are each a type of cooking oil: CORN OLIVE PALM PEANUT

Step 2: See if other puzzle words are also a type of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SPORTS PUSH-UP CORE MEAT DEMI LADY SUBSTANCE EARLY BIG THRUST SUE WIRELESS

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding four words that are each a type of the same thing.

1. **Identify two puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing:**

   - **SPORTS** and **CORE**: These don't seem to be types of the same thing.
   - **PUSH-UP** and **THRUST**: Both are types of physical movements or exercises.
   - **MEAT** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can be types of food or material, but not specific enough.
   - **DEMI** and **LADY**: Both can be types of titles or roles, but not specific enough.
   - **EARLY** and **BIG**: Both are adjectives, but not specific types of the same thing.
   - **SUE** and **WIRELESS**: These don't seem to be types of the same thing.

2. **See if other puzzle words are also a type of the same thing:**

   - **PUSH-UP**, **THRUST**, and let's see if there are other words related to physical movements or exercises:
     - **SPORTS**: Could be related as sports involve physical movements.
     - **CORE**: Often associated with core exercises.
     - **BIG**: Not directly related.
     - **EARLY**: Not directly related.
     - **MEAT**: Not directly related.
     - **DEMI**: Not directly related.
     - **LADY**: Not directly related.
     - **SUBSTANCE**: Not directly related.
     - **SUE**: Not directly related.
     - **WIRELESS**: Not directly related.

   - **SPORTS**, **PUSH-UP**, **THRUST**, **CORE**: These could all be related to physical fitness or exercise.

3. **Conclusion:**

   - A possible group of four words that are each a type of the same thing could be **SPORTS**, **PUSH-UP**, **THRUST**, and **CORE**, as they all relate to physical fitness or exercise.

If this doesn't seem to fit the pattern, we can try another approach or pattern. Let me know if you want to explore other possibilities!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each come after the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can come before each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each come after “SECRET”: AGENT CODE SANTA SAUCE
Puzzle words that each come after “FUNNY”: BONE BUSINESS GIRL PAGES
Puzzle words that each come after “SILVER”: FOX LINING SCREEN SPOON

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each share the same unique characteristic. For this pattern, the connection is with how the puzzle words are structured or how the words sound, not with what the words mean.

Steps to take:

Step 1: Say different puzzle words aloud and try to identify two puzzle words that share a unique characteristic related to how the word is structured or sounds. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular characteristics are more likely to be the correct connection than generic and ubiquitous characteristics. Think outside the box.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each heteronyms: BASS DOVE DESERT WIND
Puzzle words that are each letter spellings: BEE EX GEE JAY
Puzzle words that are each two letters + number: CANINE FREIGHT OFTEN STONE
Puzzle words that are each examples of onomatopoeia: BANG PLOP SPLASH THUD
Puzzle words that are each ”-ough” words that don’t rhyme: BOUGH COUGH DOUGH TOUGH
Puzzle words that are each words you say twice in a row: BOO POM TOM YO
Puzzle words that are each palindromes: BIB EYE GAG POP

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can have that same characteristic. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Try saying each puzzle word aloud to hear if the linguistic characteristic is present. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four words, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE LADY SPORTS DEMI SUBSTANCE CORE PUSH-UP BIG THRUST MEAT WIRELESS EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by examining the list of words and trying to identify a unique characteristic related to how the words are structured or sound.

1. **Say the words aloud**: SUE, LADY, SPORTS, DEMI, SUBSTANCE, CORE, PUSH-UP, BIG, THRUST, MEAT, WIRELESS, EARLY.

2. **Look for unique characteristics**: 
   - Consider phonetic patterns, such as rhymes, alliteration, or similar sounds.
   - Consider structural patterns, such as prefixes, suffixes, or word length.

3. **Identify potential patterns**:
   - **Compound Words**: PUSH-UP, WIRELESS (both are compound words, but we need two more).
   - **Words with Silent Letters**: DEMI (silent 'i'), CORE (silent 'e'), but this doesn't seem to fit well with others.
   - **Words with Double Letters**: None of the words have double letters.
   - **Words with a Prefix or Suffix**: SUBSTANCE (prefix 'sub-'), WIRELESS (suffix '-less'), but again, not enough matches.

4. **Re-evaluate and try another angle**:
   - **Words with a Single Syllable**: SUE, BIG, MEAT, CORE (all are single-syllable words).

5. **Check if the single-syllable pattern fits**:
   - SUE, BIG, MEAT, CORE all have one syllable. This could be a potential pattern.

6. **Verify the pattern**:
   - Say each word aloud to confirm they all have one syllable.

Based on this analysis, a possible solution could be the group of words: SUE, BIG, MEAT, CORE, as they all share the characteristic of being single-syllable words. 

If this doesn't fit the intended pattern, we can try another approach or look for a different characteristic. Let me know if you want to explore further or if this solution works!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are all within the same category

Steps to take:

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle categories are more likely to be the correct connection than simple and ubiquitous categories. Describe the category as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are all within the category of “places in France”: CHAMPAGNE DIJON NICE TOURS
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “black-and-white animals”: ORCA PANDA SKUNK ZEBRA
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “art mediums”: CHARCOAL INK PAINT PASTEL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “basic geometric objects”: LINE POINT RAY SEGMENT
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “avenues in New York City”: BROADWAY FIFTH MADISON PARK
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “cool ’80s slang”: BAD FLY FRESH RAD
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “Disney characters”: DAISY GOOFY HAPPY LADY
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “airline classes”: BUSINESS COACH FIRST PREMIUM
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “notable tv episodes”: FINALE PILOT PREMIERE SPECIAL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “classic halloween costumes”: ANGEL CLOWN PIRATE WITCH
Puzzle words that are all within the category of state abbreviations: HI LA MA OK

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can belong to that same category, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS EARLY SUBSTANCE PUSH-UP BIG MEAT SUE LADY THRUST SPORTS DEMI CORE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential categories and seeing if we can group four words together.

1. **WIRELESS**: This could relate to technology, communication, or something that operates without physical connections.

2. **EARLY**: This could relate to time, beginnings, or something that happens before others.

3. **SUBSTANCE**: This could relate to materials, chemistry, or something with physical presence.

4. **PUSH-UP**: This could relate to exercise, fitness, or something that involves physical movement.

5. **BIG**: This could relate to size, importance, or something that is large.

6. **MEAT**: This could relate to food, protein, or something that is edible.

7. **SUE**: This could relate to legal actions, names, or something involving court cases.

8. **LADY**: This could relate to gender, titles, or something involving women.

9. **THRUST**: This could relate to force, movement, or something involving propulsion.

10. **SPORTS**: This could relate to activities, games, or something involving physical competition.

11. **DEMI**: This could relate to names, partial, or something involving halves.

12. **CORE**: This could relate to central, essential, or something involving the center.

Now, let's try to find a category that fits four of these words:

- **Exercise/Fitness**: PUSH-UP, CORE, THRUST, SPORTS
  - These words can all relate to physical fitness or exercise routines.

- **Names**: DEMI, SUE, LADY, EARLY
  - These words can all be names or parts of names (Demi Moore, Sue, Lady Gaga, Early as a surname).

- **Size/Importance**: BIG, CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT
  - These words can relate to something being significant or substantial.

- **Technology/Communication**: WIRELESS, CORE, EARLY, PUSH-UP
  - These words can relate to technology or communication, though this is a bit of a stretch.

The most promising category seems to be **Exercise/Fitness** with PUSH-UP, CORE, THRUST, and SPORTS. These words all fit well within the context of physical fitness and exercise routines. 

Let's go with that as a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can explore other categories or combinations.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: LADY EARLY CORE PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE BIG DEMI WIRELESS THRUST SUE SPORTS MEAT

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying two words that could be a way to do the same thing. We'll then see if we can expand that to a group of four words.

1. **LADY**: This could refer to a woman or be used in a more specific context, like a title.
2. **EARLY**: This could mean something happening before the expected time.
3. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something, or the act of removing the core from fruit.
4. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.
5. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to a material or matter.
6. **BIG**: This is an adjective describing size.
7. **DEMI**: This could refer to something that is half or partial.
8. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without wires.
9. **THRUST**: This could mean to push or drive with force.
10. **SUE**: This means to bring a legal action against someone.
11. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games.
12. **MEAT**: This refers to animal flesh used as food.

Now, let's look for connections:

- **CORE** and **THRUST**: Both could be related to actions involving force or centrality. However, they don't seem to fit a specific pattern together.
- **PUSH-UP** and **THRUST**: Both involve physical exertion or movement, but they don't form a complete set with other words.
- **SUE**: This is a legal action, but none of the other words seem to fit this context.
- **WIRELESS**: This is related to technology, but again, no other words fit this context.

Let's try another angle:

- **CORE** and **MEAT**: Both could relate to food, but they don't form a complete set.
- **BIG** and **DEMI**: Both relate to size, but they don't form a complete set.

Let's try to find a more specific pattern:

- **PUSH-UP**, **THRUST**, **SPORTS**, **SUE**: These could all be related to actions or activities, but they don't fit a specific pattern.

It seems like we're struggling to find a set of four words that fit a specific pattern. Let's try a different approach:

- **CORE**, **SUBSTANCE**, **MEAT**, **BIG**: These could all relate to something substantial or essential, but they don't form a precise pattern.

If we can't find a set of four words that fit a specific pattern, we might need to consider a different pattern or approach. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if we should try a different set of words.
