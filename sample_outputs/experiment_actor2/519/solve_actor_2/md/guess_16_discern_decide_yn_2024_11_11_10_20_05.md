system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's analyze the words again and see if we can find a strong connection among them. We need to find a group of four words that share a unique and specific connection.

1. **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise.
2. **DEMI**: Could refer to "demi" meaning half or partial, or it could be a name.
3. **WIRELESS**: Refers to technology that operates without wires, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
4. **SUBSTANCE**: A general term that can refer to a material or matter.
5. **CORE**: Can refer to the central part of something, or in fitness, it refers to the muscles of the torso.
6. **MEAT**: A type of food, specifically animal flesh.
7. **SPORTS**: Refers to physical activities or games.
8. **THRUST**: Can refer to a forceful push or movement.

Let's try to find a connection:

- **PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS, THRUST**: These words could relate to physical fitness or exercise. However, this guess was already identified as incorrect in the notes.

- **DEMI, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, MEAT**: It's challenging to find a specific connection among these words. They don't seem to fit into a clear category or share a unique characteristic.

- **CORE, THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS**: This was the initial guess, but it was incorrect.

Given the constraints and the words provided, it seems we don't have a strong alternative guess that fits the criteria. The notes only provided one potential solution, which was already incorrect. Without additional context or words, it's difficult to form a new viable guess.

Since the notes didn't provide any other viable solutions and the initial guess was incorrect, we might need to reconsider the words or look for a different angle. However, based on the information provided, we don't have enough to form a new, strong guess.

Based on the analysis, I recommend going back to brainstorming other possible connections. We don't have a strong guess to submit at this time. Let's look for additional clues or reconsider the context to find a viable solution.

user: Yes = submit a guess. No = go back to brainstorming.
