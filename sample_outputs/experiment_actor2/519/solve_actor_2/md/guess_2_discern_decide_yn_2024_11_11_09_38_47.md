system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's analyze the notes and the words provided to determine if there is a strong guess to submit.

1. **SPORTS, CRUNCH, CORE, PUSH-UP**: This connection was considered but noted that "sports" is more general compared to the other words, which are specific exercises. This makes it a weaker connection.

2. **PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE, CRUNCH**: This connection relates to candy brands, which is a strong pop culture reference. All four words are directly related to candy brands, making it a cohesive group.

3. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, BIG**: This connection was considered within the "fitness/exercise" category, but "big" doesn't fit as neatly as the others, which are specific exercises. This makes it a weaker connection.

4. **PAYDAY, DOVE, MARS, CRUNCH**: This connection can modify "bar" to form candy bar names. This is a very strong connection because each word can directly precede "bar" to form a well-known candy bar name.

Given these analyses, the strongest guess from the notes is **PAYDAY, DOVE, MARS, CRUNCH** with the connection being "words that can modify 'bar' to form candy bar names." This connection is precise, specific, and applies equally well to all four words.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess: **PAYDAY, DOVE, MARS, CRUNCH** with the connection being "words that can modify 'bar' to form candy bar names."
