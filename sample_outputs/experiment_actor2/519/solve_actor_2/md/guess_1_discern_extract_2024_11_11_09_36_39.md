## Prompts

system: ""”

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 

Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, as outlined in the instructions.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things.**

1. **PAYDAY and EARLY**: These could both relate to time or events, but it's not a strong connection.
2. **DOVE and LADY**: These could both be names or brands, but again, not a strong connection.
3. **WIRELESS and MARS**: These could relate to technology or space, but it's a stretch.
4. **MEAT and CORE**: These could relate to food or something central, but not a strong connection.
5. **SPORTS and CRUNCH**: These could relate to fitness or exercise.
6. **DEMI and SUE**: These could be names, but not a strong connection.
7. **PUSH-UP and CRUNCH**: These are both exercises.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category.**

Let's explore the category of exercises:

- **PUSH-UP**: A common exercise.
- **CRUNCH**: Another common exercise.
- **THRUST**: This could be related to exercises, like hip thrusts.
- **CORE**: Often associated with exercises targeting the core muscles.

This gives us a potential category of "exercises" with the words PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, THRUST, and CORE.

Let's verify if this category is unique and subtle enough for a New York Times puzzle. Exercises are a common category, but the specific selection of these words might fit the puzzle's requirements.

If this doesn't seem correct, we can try another pattern. Let me know if you want to explore further or if you have any other thoughts!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are each a way to do the same thing. 

1. **Identify potential connections:**
   - **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, DOVE**: These words could be related to physical actions or exercises. "Thrust," "push-up," and "crunch" are all exercises or movements, while "dove" could be interpreted as a diving action.
   - **SPORTS, BIG, LADY, DEMI**: These words could relate to categories or descriptors, but they don't seem to fit a specific action or process.
   - **MARS, EARLY, PAYDAY, WIRELESS**: These words seem more abstract or unrelated to a specific action.
   - **SUE, CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE**: These words could relate to legal actions or core elements, but they don't seem to fit a specific action.

2. **Refine the connections:**
   - Let's focus on the physical actions: **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, DOVE**. These words can be interpreted as movements or exercises:
     - **THRUST**: A forceful push or movement.
     - **PUSH-UP**: An exercise involving pushing the body up.
     - **CRUNCH**: An abdominal exercise.
     - **DOVE**: Past tense of "dive," which is a movement.

3. **Check for consistency:**
   - These words all describe different types of physical movements or exercises, which could be a way to "move the body" or "perform an exercise."

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The group of words **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, DOVE** fits the pattern of being different ways to perform physical movements or exercises.

If this doesn't seem to fit the intended pattern, we can explore other combinations or interpretations. Let me know if you want to try another approach!

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding four words that can be synonymous adjectives. 

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives.**

1. **BIG**: This can be an adjective meaning large in size or importance.
2. **EARLY**: This can be an adjective meaning happening or done before the usual or expected time.

These two words don't seem to be synonymous, so let's try another pair.

1. **CRUNCH**: This can be an adjective in the context of a "crunch situation," meaning critical or decisive.
2. **THRUST**: This can be an adjective in the context of a "thrust area," meaning main or primary.

These two words don't seem to be synonymous either. Let's try another pair.

1. **WIRELESS**: This can be an adjective meaning without wires.
2. **SUBSTANCE**: This doesn't seem to fit as an adjective synonym with any other word here.

Let's try another pair.

1. **LADY**: This can be an adjective in the context of "lady-like," meaning refined or elegant.
2. **DEMI**: This can be an adjective meaning half or partial.

These two words don't seem to be synonymous either. Let's try another pair.

1. **MARS**: This doesn't seem to fit as an adjective synonym with any other word here.
2. **SUE**: This doesn't seem to fit as an adjective synonym with any other word here.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.**

Let's try to find a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives:

1. **BIG**: Large in size or importance.
2. **CORE**: Central or most important part.
3. **MAIN**: Chief or most important.
4. **PRINCIPAL**: First in order of importance.

Unfortunately, "MAIN" and "PRINCIPAL" are not in the list, so let's try another approach.

1. **DEMI**: Half or partial.
2. **LADY**: Refined or elegant.
3. **EARLY**: Before the usual or expected time.
4. **WIRELESS**: Without wires.

These words don't seem to form a coherent group of synonymous adjectives.

**Conclusion:**

I wasn't able to find a group of four words that fit the pattern of synonymous adjectives from the given list. It might be helpful to try another pattern or provide additional context or clues. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern we should consider.

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding synonyms that function as the same part of speech.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms.**

1. **WIRELESS**: This could be an adjective meaning "without wires."
2. **MARS**: This is a proper noun, referring to the planet or the Roman god of war.
3. **PAYDAY**: This is a noun, meaning the day on which someone is paid.
4. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a noun, meaning the physical matter of which a person or thing consists.
5. **BIG**: This is an adjective, meaning large in size.
6. **DOVE**: This is a noun, referring to a type of bird or a person who advocates for peace.
7. **THRUST**: This can be a verb meaning "to push with force" or a noun meaning "a strong push."
8. **CORE**: This is a noun, meaning the central or most important part of something.
9. **SUE**: This is a verb, meaning to bring a legal action against someone.
10. **EARLY**: This is an adjective or adverb, meaning before the usual or expected time.
11. **SPORTS**: This is a noun, referring to physical activities involving skill and competition.
12. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun, referring to a physical exercise.
13. **CRUNCH**: This can be a verb meaning "to crush with the teeth" or a noun meaning "a decisive moment."
14. **LADY**: This is a noun, meaning a woman.
15. **DEMI**: This is an adjective, meaning half or partial.
16. **MEAT**: This is a noun, meaning the flesh of an animal used as food.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.**

Let's start with the word **THRUST** as a verb meaning "to push with force." We can look for other words that can be synonymous with this meaning:

- **THRUST**: Verb meaning "to push with force."
- **PUSH-UP**: While primarily a noun, it involves the action of pushing.
- **CRUNCH**: As a verb, it can mean to exert pressure or force.
- **SUE**: This doesn't fit the pattern of pushing or force.

Let's try another angle:

- **BIG**: Adjective meaning large in size.
- **DEMI**: This doesn't fit as a synonym for "big."
- **EARLY**: This doesn't fit as a synonym for "big."
- **LADY**: This doesn't fit as a synonym for "big."

Let's try another angle:

- **CORE**: Noun meaning the central or most important part.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Noun meaning the physical matter, could be considered the core of something.
- **MEAT**: Noun meaning the flesh of an animal, often considered the core or main part of a meal.
- **THRUST**: As a noun, it can mean the main point or essence, similar to core.

This gives us a potential group of synonyms:

- **CORE**: Noun meaning the central or most important part.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Noun meaning the physical matter or essence.
- **MEAT**: Noun meaning the main part or essence of something.
- **THRUST**: As a noun, it can mean the main point or essence.

This group of words can be synonymous when considering the essence or main part of something. Let me know if this works or if we should try another pattern!

15. **PAYDAY** - loan, bar, advance, lender
16. **SPORTS** - car, bar, center, team

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same letters or words that commonly follow them**

Let's look for a common set of letters or words that can follow four of these puzzle words:

- **CRUNCH** - bar
- **PAYDAY** - bar
- **MARS** - bar
- **MEAT** - bar

These words can all be followed by "bar."

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have the same letters follow them**

We have identified four words that can be followed by "bar":

1. **CRUNCH** - bar
2. **PAYDAY** - bar
3. **MARS** - bar
4. **MEAT** - bar

This set of words fits the pattern where each word can be followed by "bar."
