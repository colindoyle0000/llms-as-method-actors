Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully evaluate the notes and the words provided to determine if there is a strong guess to submit.

1. **Incorrect Guess**: CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS
   - This combination was already tried and found to be incorrect, so we should avoid any guess that includes all four of these words together.

2. **Brainstorming Note #3**:
   - **Solution**: MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, CORE
   - **Explanation**: These words are connected by the idea of being the main part or essence of something. They are each a kind of "essence" or "central part."

3. **Brainstorming Note #4**:
   - **Solution**: SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE
   - **Explanation**: These words can be synonymous in the sense of "core" or "essence." However, a fourth word was not identified in this note.

Given the notes, the strongest viable guess is from Brainstorming Note #3: MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, CORE. This guess includes four words that are all connected by the idea of being the main part or essence of something, and it does not repeat the incorrect guess.

Therefore, the top choice for a guess to submit is: **MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, CORE**.

Let's submit this guess as it seems to be the strongest option based on the notes provided.

user: Yes = submit a guess. No = go back to brainstorming.
