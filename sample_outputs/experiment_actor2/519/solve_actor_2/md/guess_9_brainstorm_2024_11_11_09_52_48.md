Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous verbs.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to shepherd”: DIRECT GUIDE LEAD STEER
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to contact via phone”: BUZZ CALL DIAL RING
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to separate”: DIVIDE FORK PART SPLIT
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to pester”: BADGER BUG HOUND NAG
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to get low”: CROUCH DUCK SQUAT STOOP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to make happy”: AMUSE DELIGHT PLEASE TICKLE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to reserve for later”: BANK SAVE STASH STORE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to restrain”: CHECK CURB LIMIT STEM
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to move quickly”: BOLT DART DASH ZIP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to update for accuracy”: AMEND CORRECT FIX REVISE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to breathe heavily”: GASPS HUFFS PANTS PUFFS

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: EARLY SUBSTANCE WIRELESS SPORTS BIG PUSH-UP SUE DEMI CORE MEAT LADY THRUST

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential synonymous verbs among the given words. 

1. **EARLY**: As a verb, "early" doesn't seem to fit well. Let's move on.

2. **SUBSTANCE**: This is typically a noun, but let's consider if it can be a verb. "Substance" doesn't work as a verb synonymously with others here.

3. **WIRELESS**: This is primarily an adjective or noun, not a verb.

4. **SPORTS**: As a verb, "sport" can mean to display or wear something. Let's keep this in mind.

5. **BIG**: This is usually an adjective, not a verb.

6. **PUSH-UP**: As a verb, "push" can mean to thrust or shove. Let's consider this.

7. **SUE**: As a verb, "sue" means to take legal action. This is quite specific.

8. **DEMI**: This is typically a prefix or a noun, not a verb.

9. **CORE**: As a verb, "core" can mean to remove the central part of something, like an apple.

10. **MEAT**: This is typically a noun, not a verb.

11. **LADY**: This is a noun, not a verb.

12. **THRUST**: As a verb, "thrust" means to push or drive with force.

Now, let's see if we can find a group of four words that can be synonymous verbs:

- **PUSH-UP** and **THRUST**: Both can mean to push or drive with force.
- **SPORTS**: As a verb, it doesn't fit with "push" or "thrust."
- **CORE**: As a verb, it doesn't fit with "push" or "thrust."

It seems like "PUSH-UP" and "THRUST" are the closest pair we have, but we need two more words to form a group of four synonymous verbs. Let's try another approach:

- **SUE**: As a verb, it means to take legal action. This is quite specific and doesn't match with others.

Given the current list, it seems challenging to find four words that fit the pattern of synonymous verbs. We might need to consider a different pattern or a new set of words. Let me know if you want to try another approach or if there are additional words to consider.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each homophones

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm potential homophones.

Step 2: Narrow down the list to only include puzzle words that are homophones.

Step 3: From the list of puzzle words that are homophones, try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that each have a common connection. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. 

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each homophones of names of animals: DEAR HAIR HOARSE WAIL
Puzzle words that are each homophones of Greek Letters: MOO NEW PIE ROW

If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over.

Example Input and Output:

Input:

Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: ANGEL, PIRATE, SPELL, WAIL, WITCH, HIVE, COMB,  WAX, DEAR, HAIR, HONEY,  HOARSE, PERIOD, STRETCH, WHILE, CLOWN

Output:

Let’s examine the list of words provided to see which ones are homophones, then narrow down the list to actual homophones, and then see if any are homophones based on a similar connection:

**Step 1: Identify Homophones**

For each word in the list, let’s say the word aloud to find out if it is a homophone

Angel - No homophone comes to mind

Pirate - No homophone comes to mind

Spell - No homophone comes to mind

Wail - Possible homophone “whale” like the sea animal

Witch - Possible homophone “which”

Hive - Possible homophone “I’ve”

Comb - Maybe a homphone of “come”

Wax - No homophone comes to mind

Dear - Possible homophone “deer”

Hair - Possible homophone “hare” or “here” or “hear”

Honey - No homophone comes to mind

Hoarse - Possible homophone “horse”

Period - No homophone comes to mind

Stretch - No homophone comes to mind

While - Possible homophone “wile” or “wild”

Clown - No homophone comes to mind

**Step 2: Narrow down list**

Wail - Possible homophone “whale” like the sea animal

Hive - Possible homophone “I’ve”

Comb - Maybe a homphone of “come”

Dear - Possible homophone “deer”

Hair - Possible homophone “hare” or “here” or “hear”

Hoarse - Possible homophone “horse”

While - Possible homophone “wile” or “wild”

**Step 3: Extract connection from list**

There does appear to be a common set of homophones here. The connection is “animal homophones” and the words are:

WAIL, DEAR, HAIR, HOARSE

— end of example input and output —


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: EARLY LADY DEMI THRUST SUE CORE SUBSTANCE WIRELESS PUSH-UP BIG SPORTS MEAT

## Output

Let's go through the steps to identify a possible solution to this puzzle.

**Step 1: Identify Homophones**

For each word in the list, let’s say the word aloud to find out if it is a homophone:

- Early - No homophone comes to mind
- Lady - No homophone comes to mind
- Demi - No homophone comes to mind
- Thrust - No homophone comes to mind
- Sue - Possible homophone "sue" (legal action) and "sioux" (Native American tribe)
- Core - Possible homophone "corps" (military unit)
- Substance - No homophone comes to mind
- Wireless - No homophone comes to mind
- Push-up - No homophone comes to mind
- Big - No homophone comes to mind
- Sports - No homophone comes to mind
- Meat - Possible homophone "meet" (to encounter)

**Step 2: Narrow down the list**

- Sue - Possible homophone "sioux"
- Core - Possible homophone "corps"
- Meat - Possible homophone "meet"

**Step 3: Extract connection from list**

We need to find a fourth word that fits a common connection with the identified homophones. Let's consider possible connections:

- "Sue" (Sioux) and "Core" (Corps) could relate to groups or organizations.
- "Meat" (Meet) could relate to gatherings or meetings.

Unfortunately, we only have three words that fit a potential pattern. Let's consider if there might be another word in the list that could fit a similar connection or if we need to try another pattern.

If we can't find a fourth word, we may need to explore other potential homophones or connections. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if we should try a different approach.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each come after the same prefixes or words

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm prefixes or words that can come before each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular prefixes or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous prefixes or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each come after “tele”: COMMUTE MEDICINE PROMPTER VISION
Puzzle words that each come after “deep”: CUT FAKE FREEZE SIX
Puzzle words that each come after “belly”: BUTTON DANCE FLOP LAUGH

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can have the same prefix or word come before them.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same prefix or word, trying to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each have the same prefix or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: ABSURDITY PROGRESS NONSENSE ADVANCE MARCH SKUNK MADNESS PUSH CUT FREEZE FEET GARBAGE CHEESE FOLLY FAKE SIX

Output:

Let’s examine the list of puzzle words provided to see what prefixes or words come before these puzzle words, then identify puzzle words from the list that have the same prefixes or words that commonly come before them, then identify what other puzzle words could form this connection, then arrive at a conclusion.

**Step 1: Prefixes or words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**ABSURDITY** - sheer, utter, complete

**PROGRESS** - steady, significant, slow

**NONSENSE** - complete, utter, sheer

**ADVANCE** - in, rapid, significant

**MARCH** - long, slow, annual

**SKUNK** - striped, little, dead

**MADNESS** - sheer, utter, pure

**PUSH** - final, gentle, big

**CUT** - deep, budget, price

**FREEZE** - deep, sudden, hard

**FEET** - bare, tired, sore

**GARBAGE** - household, kitchen, street

**CHEESE** - cheddar, blue, cream

**FOLLY** - sheer, utter, complete

**FAKE** - news, ID, tan

**SIX** - number, at, o'clock

**Step 2: Puzzle Words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Sheer - Folly, Absurdity, Madness, Nonsense

Deep - Freeze, Cut

**Step 3: Other puzzle words that could form the connection of “deep”**

**ABSURDITY** - No

**PROGRESS** - No

**NONSENSE** - No

**ADVANCE** - No

**MARCH** - Maybe

**SKUNK** - No

**MADNESS** - No

**PUSH** - No

**FEET** - No

**GARBAGE** - No

**CHEESE** - No

**FOLLY** - No

**FAKE** - Yes!

**SIX** - Yes!

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Two good possibilities:

Puzzle Words that follow sheer: FOLLY ABSURDITY MADNESS NONSENSE

Puzzle Words that follow deep: CUT FAKE FREEZE SIX

— end of example input and output —


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST SUE LADY BIG WIRELESS SUBSTANCE EARLY MEAT DEMI CORE SPORTS PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's work through this step by step to find a possible solution to the puzzle.

**Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm prefixes or words that can come before each puzzle word.**

**THRUST** - rocket, power, forward

**SUE** - file, pursue, legal

**LADY** - first, young, leading

**BIG** - shot, deal, time

**WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology

**SUBSTANCE** - chemical, controlled, active

**EARLY** - bird, morning, riser

**MEAT** - red, white, ground

**DEMI** - god, moore, tasse

**CORE** - apple, hard, inner

**SPORTS** - car, news, team

**PUSH-UP** - exercise, bra, challenge

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that can have the same prefix or word come before them.**

Let's look for common prefixes or words:

- **BIG**: Big shot, big deal, big time
- **WIRELESS**: Wireless network, wireless connection, wireless technology
- **EARLY**: Early bird, early morning, early riser
- **SPORTS**: Sports car, sports news, sports team

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same prefix or word, trying to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each have the same prefix or word.**

Let's try to find a group of four:

- **BIG**: Big shot, big deal, big time
- **WIRELESS**: Wireless network, wireless connection, wireless technology
- **EARLY**: Early bird, early morning, early riser
- **SPORTS**: Sports car, sports news, sports team

Unfortunately, none of these groups have four words. Let's try another approach.

**Step 4: Try another pattern or combination.**

Let's try to find another common prefix or word:

- **THRUST**: Rocket thrust, power thrust, forward thrust
- **PUSH-UP**: Exercise push-up, bra push-up, challenge push-up

Again, we don't have four words. Let's try another approach.

**Step 5: Consider other possibilities.**

Let's try to find another common prefix or word:

- **CORE**: Apple core, hard core, inner core
- **DEMI**: Demi-god, Demi Moore, Demi-tasse

Again, we don't have four words. Let's try another approach.

**Conclusion:**

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a group of four words that follow the same prefix or word pattern. We might need to consider a different pattern or get more information to solve this puzzle. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern we should try.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT SUBSTANCE SPORTS THRUST DEMI BIG WIRELESS PUSH-UP SUE CORE EARLY LADY

## Output

Alright, let's tackle this step by step.

**Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that are one letter away from each puzzle word.**

1. MEAT: MATE, BEAT, SEAT, HEAT
2. SUBSTANCE: SUBSTANCES, SUBSTANCEY
3. SPORTS: SORTS, PORTS, SHORTS
4. THRUST: TRUST, THIRST, THRUSH
5. DEMI: DIME, DEEM, DEBI
6. BIG: BAG, BUG, BOG
7. WIRELESS: WIRELESSY, WIRELESSS
8. PUSH-UP: PUSHUPS, PUSH-UPY
9. SUE: DUE, CUE, SEE
10. CORE: CURE, CARE, COVE
11. EARLY: YEARLY, EARLYS
12. LADY: LACY, LARD, LAND

**Step 2: Identify a connection between the words that you’ve brainstormed that applies to multiple puzzle words.**

Let's look for a common theme or category among the brainstormed words:

- MEAT (MATE, BEAT, SEAT, HEAT): These could relate to actions or states (e.g., MATE as in pairing, BEAT as in rhythm).
- SUBSTANCE: Hard to find a one-letter-away word that fits a theme.
- SPORTS (SORTS, PORTS, SHORTS): These could relate to categories or types.
- THRUST (TRUST, THIRST, THRUSH): These could relate to actions or states.
- DEMI (DIME, DEEM, DEBI): These could relate to names or values.
- BIG (BAG, BUG, BOG): These could relate to objects or states.
- WIRELESS: Hard to find a one-letter-away word that fits a theme.
- PUSH-UP: Hard to find a one-letter-away word that fits a theme.
- SUE (DUE, CUE, SEE): These could relate to actions or states.
- CORE (CURE, CARE, COVE): These could relate to actions or states.
- EARLY (YEARLY, EARLYS): These could relate to time or frequency.
- LADY (LACY, LARD, LAND): These could relate to objects or states.

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words can share the connection, trying to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each one letter away from a word that shares something else in common.**

Let's try to find a group of four words that fit a common theme:

1. MEAT (MATE): Could relate to pairing or relationships.
2. SPORTS (SORTS): Could relate to categories or types.
3. THRUST (TRUST): Could relate to actions or states.
4. SUE (CUE): Could relate to actions or states.

These words could potentially relate to actions or states, but it's not a strong connection. Let's try another approach:

1. MEAT (HEAT): Relates to temperature.
2. CORE (CURE): Relates to health or wellness.
3. EARLY (YEARLY): Relates to time or frequency.
4. LADY (LACY): Relates to fashion or appearance.

This group doesn't seem to fit a strong common theme either. Let's try one more:

1. MEAT (BEAT): Relates to rhythm or music.
2. SPORTS (SHORTS): Relates to clothing.
3. THRUST (THRUSH): Relates to birds.
4. BIG (BUG): Relates to insects.

This group doesn't fit a strong common theme either. It seems like we might need to try another pattern or approach. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if we should try a different pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI MEAT LADY WIRELESS CORE THRUST SPORTS EARLY BIG SUE PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We need to find a subtle connection between four of these words. 

1. **DEMI**: This could refer to something that is half or partial, like "demigod" or "demitasse."

2. **MEAT**: This is a type of food, but it could also refer to the core or substance of something, as in "the meat of the argument."

3. **LADY**: This refers to a woman, but it could also be used in specific contexts like "First Lady" or "Lady Luck."

4. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without wires, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

5. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something, like the core of an apple or the core of the Earth.

6. **THRUST**: This could refer to a forceful push or drive, often used in contexts like "rocket thrust."

7. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games, but it could also be used in contexts like "sports car."

8. **EARLY**: This refers to something happening before the usual or expected time.

9. **BIG**: This refers to something large in size or importance.

10. **SUE**: This could refer to taking legal action against someone.

11. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise, but it could also refer to something that enhances or lifts, like a "push-up bra."

12. **SUBSTANCE**: This refers to a particular kind of matter or material, but it could also mean the essence or core of something.

Now, let's try to find a connection:

- **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE** both refer to the essence or central part of something.
- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP** both involve a forceful movement or lift.

Let's see if we can find a common theme:

- **CORE**, **SUBSTANCE**, **THRUST**, and **PUSH-UP** could all relate to the concept of "strength" or "central force." 

However, this connection might not be subtle enough. Let's try another angle:

- **DEMI**, **LADY**, **BIG**, and **EARLY** could all relate to descriptors or modifiers. For example, "demi" as in half, "lady" as in a title, "big" as in size, and "early" as in time. 

This is a bit abstract, but it could be a direction to explore. Let's refine this:

- **DEMI** (half), **LADY** (title), **BIG** (size), and **EARLY** (time) could all be seen as adjectives or descriptors that modify nouns.

This might be a more subtle connection. Let's go with this set: **DEMI**, **LADY**, **BIG**, **EARLY**.

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern. Let me know if you want to explore further!
