You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's evaluate the two guesses from the notes and see if either is strong enough to submit:

1. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**:
   - **Explanation**: These words are related to physical exercise or fitness. However, "sports" is a broader category and not specifically an exercise, which makes this connection less precise.

2. **CORE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**:
   - **Explanation**: These words connect to different meanings of the word "essence" or "central part." "Core" and "substance" fit well with this theme. "Thrust" as the main point or force also aligns with this idea. "Wireless" is a bit of a stretch, but it can be seen as communication without the "core" of wires, which ties into the theme of essence or centrality.

Given the options, the second guess, **CORE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**, seems to have a more unique and precise connection, which aligns with the typical complexity of New York Times puzzles. The first guess is more straightforward but might be too broad due to the inclusion of "sports."

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess **CORE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**. This guess has a more nuanced connection that fits the criteria for a strong guess in this type of puzzle./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
