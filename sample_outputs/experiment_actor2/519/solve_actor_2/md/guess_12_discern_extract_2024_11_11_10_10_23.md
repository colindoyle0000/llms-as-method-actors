You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 

Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding four words that can mean the same thing and function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can mean the same thing.

1. **SUE** and **DEMI**: These don't seem to have a direct connection in meaning.
2. **SPORTS** and **WIRELESS**: No direct connection here either.
3. **PUSH-UP** and **BIG**: Again, no direct connection.
4. **LADY** and **EARLY**: No direct connection.

Let's try another approach by looking at each word individually and seeing if we can find synonyms among them:

- **SUE**: As a verb, it means to take legal action against someone.
- **SPORTS**: As a noun, it refers to physical activities or games.
- **DEMI**: As an adjective, it means half or partial.
- **WIRELESS**: As an adjective, it means without wires, often referring to technology.
- **PUSH-UP**: As a noun, it refers to a physical exercise.
- **BIG**: As an adjective, it means large in size.
- **LADY**: As a noun, it refers to a woman.
- **EARLY**: As an adjective or adverb, it means before the usual or expected time.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also mean the same thing.

Let's try to find a group of four words that can mean the same thing:

1. **BIG** and **LADY**: These don't connect directly.
2. **EARLY** and **WIRELESS**: No direct connection.
3. **SUE** and **PUSH-UP**: No direct connection.
4. **SPORTS** and **DEMI**: No direct connection.

Let's try another angle:

- **BIG** and **LADY**: If we consider "big" as "important" and "lady" as "a woman of importance," we might have a connection, but we need two more words.
- **EARLY** and **WIRELESS**: No connection.
- **SUE** and **PUSH-UP**: No connection.
- **SPORTS** and **DEMI**: No connection.

It seems like we're not finding a clear group of four words that can mean the same thing. Let's try another pattern or see if there's another angle we haven't considered. If you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern to try, let me know!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We need to find a category where each of these words can be a part of a different word within that category. Let's start by examining each word and see if we can identify any potential categories.

1. **SUE**: This could be part of "lawsuit" or "pursue." 
2. **BIG**: This could be part of "bigfoot" or "bigwig."
3. **LADY**: This could be part of "ladybug" or "landlady."
4. **WIRELESS**: This could be part of "wireless network" or "wireless charger."
5. **SPORTS**: This could be part of "sportswear" or "sportsmanship."
6. **PUSH-UP**: This could be part of "push-up bra" or "push-up exercise."
7. **DEMI**: This could be part of "demigod" or "demitasse."
8. **EARLY**: This could be part of "early bird" or "early riser."

Now, let's try to find a category that fits four of these words:

- **SUE** and **BIG** could both be part of legal terms: "lawsuit" and "bigwig" (a person of importance, often in legal or business contexts).
- **LADY** and **DEMI** could both be part of titles or roles: "landlady" and "demigod."

Let's see if we can find a more cohesive category:

- **WIRELESS** and **SPORTS** could both be part of technology or equipment: "wireless network" and "sportswear."
- **PUSH-UP** and **EARLY** could both be part of fitness or routines: "push-up exercise" and "early riser."

It seems like we're struggling to find a single category that fits four words perfectly. Let's try another approach:

- **SUE**, **BIG**, **LADY**, and **DEMI** could all be part of names or titles: "lawsuit," "bigwig," "landlady," and "demigod."

This seems like a plausible category. Let's go with names or titles as our category:

1. **SUE** - "lawsuit"
2. **BIG** - "bigwig"
3. **LADY** - "landlady"
4. **DEMI** - "demigod"

This is a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or category. Let me know if you need further assistance!

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's tackle this step by step. We need to find a word that each of the puzzle words can modify. 

1. **WIRELESS**: This can modify "network" (wireless network), "headphones" (wireless headphones), "mouse" (wireless mouse), etc.

2. **PUSH-UP**: This can modify "bra" (push-up bra), "exercise" (push-up exercise), etc.

3. **DEMI**: This can modify "moore" (Demi Moore), "glace" (demi-glace), "god" (demigod), etc.

4. **EARLY**: This can modify "bird" (early bird), "morning" (early morning), "adopter" (early adopter), etc.

5. **BIG**: This can modify "deal" (big deal), "bang" (big bang), "apple" (Big Apple), etc.

6. **LADY**: This can modify "gaga" (Lady Gaga), "bug" (ladybug), "luck" (lady luck), etc.

7. **SPORTS**: This can modify "car" (sports car), "team" (sports team), "bar" (sports bar), etc.

8. **SUE**: This can modify "storm" (Sue Storm), "grafton" (Sue Grafton), "bird" (Sue Bird), etc.

Now, let's see if we can find a common word that four of these can modify:

- **EARLY** and **BIRD**: "Early bird"
- **BIG** and **BIRD**: "Big bird"
- **LADY** and **BIRD**: "Ladybird"
- **SUE** and **BIRD**: "Sue Bird"

It seems like "BIRD" is a word that can be modified by EARLY, BIG, LADY, and SUE. 

Therefore, the four words that match the pattern are: EARLY, BIG, LADY, and SUE, all modifying "BIRD". 

Let me know if you need further assistance or if you want to try another pattern!

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are each a kind of the same thing.

1. **DEMI**: This could refer to a type of bra (demi-cup), a type of person (demigod), or a type of size (demi-glace).

2. **SUE**: This could refer to a type of legal action (lawsuit), or it could be a name.

3. **SPORTS**: This could refer to a type of activity (sports), or a type of bra (sports bra).

4. **BIG**: This could refer to size, or it could be part of a name or title (e.g., Big Ben).

5. **PUSH-UP**: This could refer to a type of exercise, or a type of bra (push-up bra).

6. **LADY**: This could refer to a type of person (lady), or it could be part of a name or title (e.g., Lady Gaga).

7. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to a type of technology (wireless technology), or a type of bra (wireless bra).

8. **EARLY**: This could refer to time (early morning), or it could be part of a name or title.

Now, let's see if we can find a connection:

- **DEMI**, **SPORTS**, **PUSH-UP**, **WIRELESS**: These are all types of bras. 

This seems to be a plausible connection. Each of these words can describe a type of bra:

- **DEMI**: Demi-cup bra
- **SPORTS**: Sports bra
- **PUSH-UP**: Push-up bra
- **WIRELESS**: Wireless bra

This group of four words fits the pattern of being each a kind of the same thing. If this solution seems correct, we can proceed with it. If not, we can explore other potential connections.

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential synonymous nouns among the given puzzle words: WIRELESS, DEMI, BIG, LADY, SUE, SPORTS, EARLY, PUSH-UP.

1. **WIRELESS**: As a noun, "wireless" can refer to a radio or a wireless communication device. However, it's not a common noun synonym with the other words at first glance.

2. **DEMI**: "Demi" is often used as a prefix meaning "half" or "partial," but as a standalone noun, it doesn't immediately suggest a synonym with the other words.

3. **BIG**: As a noun, "big" could refer to something large or significant, but it's more commonly used as an adjective.

4. **LADY**: As a noun, "lady" refers to a woman or a female of high social status. It could potentially be synonymous with other words that refer to women or titles.

5. **SUE**: As a noun, "sue" doesn't have a direct meaning, but as a verb, it means to take legal action. However, we're focusing on nouns.

6. **SPORTS**: As a noun, "sports" refers to physical activities or games. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym with the other words.

7. **EARLY**: As a noun, "early" could refer to an early time or period, but it's more commonly used as an adjective or adverb.

8. **PUSH-UP**: As a noun, "push-up" refers to a type of exercise. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym with the other words.

Now, let's see if we can find any connections:

- **LADY**: This is the most promising word to start with, as it can be synonymous with other words referring to women or titles. Let's explore this further.

Possible synonyms for "LADY" could include:
- **DAME**: A title for a woman, especially in British English.
- **MISS**: A title for a young woman.
- **MA'AM**: A respectful term for a woman.

Unfortunately, none of the other words in the list directly match these synonyms. Let's try another approach:

- **SPORTS**: Could potentially be synonymous with activities or games. However, none of the other words fit this category.

- **EARLY**: Could be synonymous with beginnings or starts, but again, none of the other words fit this category.

Given the current list of words, it seems challenging to find a group of four that are synonymous nouns. We might need to consider a different pattern or set of words. If you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern to explore, let me know!
