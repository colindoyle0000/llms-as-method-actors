Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you’re the best at New York Times connections puzzles. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

This puzzle is just like a New York Times connections puzzle. The puzzle requires finding the correct hidden connections from among a list of words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have something in common.

Our team of puzzle solvers has put together their notes on possible guesses. We need a fresh set of eyes on these options.

Step One: Look over those notes and consider the strength of each guess. 

For each guess, write down how well the guess conforms to the following features of strong guesses:

- As this is a New York Times puzzle, the connection between the four words is trickier than simple connections like “5-letter word,” “Name,” or “Verb” that could apply to many groups of words. The connections should be unique to this particular group of words.
- The connection fits each of the four words equally well. Look out for one word that doesn’t quite fit!
- The connection applies with the same level of specificity for each of the four words.
- Each of the four words has the same relationship to the connection. Look out for whether one word functions as a different part of speech than the other words as this often indicates a weak guess.

Step Two: Select your two top choices for guesses to submit.

Your two top choices should not have any words that overlap with each other, because that would indicate that one of the two guesses is wrong. 

Step Three: Determine which of your two top choices is strongest and select that one to submit.

Notes on possible guesses:

Guess: 
CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY
 Rationale: 
The words CRUNCH, DOVE, MARS, and PAYDAY are all names of candy brands. Additionally, each word can precede "bar" to form the name of a well-known candy bar.
Guess: 
CRUNCH LADY PAYDAY SPORTS
 Rationale: 
The words CRUNCH, LADY, PAYDAY, and SPORTS can each follow the word "BIG" to form common phrases: "big crunch," "big lady," "big payday," and "big sports." This connection is based on the ability of each word to pair with "big" to create familiar expressions.
Guess: 
CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS
 Rationale: 
The words "SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI, CORE" are connected as they all relate to types or features of bras. Each word represents a specific style or characteristic commonly associated with bras.
Guess: 
CRUNCH MARS MEAT PAYDAY
 Rationale: 
The words CRUNCH, MARS, MEAT, and PAYDAY are all connected because they can be followed by the word "bar." Each of these words is commonly associated with a type of bar, such as a candy bar or protein bar.


Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. At the end, write down your top choice for a guess to submit. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: What is your top choice for a guess to submit for this puzzle? EARLY DEMI CORE PUSH-UP BIG THRUST MARS PAYDAY WIRELESS SUE SUBSTANCE MEAT CRUNCH DOVE SPORTS LADY

## Output

Let's analyze each of the guesses provided in the notes and evaluate their strength based on the criteria given:

1. **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: 
   - Connection: These are all names of candy brands and can precede "bar" to form candy bar names.
   - Strength: This is a strong connection because it is specific and unique to these words. Each word fits the connection equally well, and they all have the same relationship to the connection.

2. **CRUNCH LADY PAYDAY SPORTS**:
   - Connection: These words can follow "BIG" to form common phrases.
   - Strength: This connection is weaker because "big lady" is not as common or specific as the other phrases. The connection is not as unique or specific as the candy bar connection.

3. **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**:
   - Connection: These words relate to types or features of bras.
   - Strength: This is a strong connection because it is specific and applies equally to each word. Each word represents a style or characteristic associated with bras.

4. **CRUNCH MARS MEAT PAYDAY**:
   - Connection: These words can be followed by "bar."
   - Strength: This is similar to the first guess but includes "MEAT," which is less commonly associated with a "bar" in the same context as the others. This weakens the connection slightly compared to the first guess.

Now, let's select the top two choices that do not overlap:

- **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY** (Candy bars)
- **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS** (Bra types/features)

These two guesses do not overlap in terms of words, making them strong candidates.

Finally, let's determine which of these two is the strongest:

- **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: This connection is very strong due to its specificity and the well-known nature of these candy bars.
- **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: This is also a strong connection, but it might be slightly less universally recognized than the candy bar connection.

Given the criteria and the need for a unique and specific connection, my top choice for submission is **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**. This guess has a clear, specific, and widely recognized connection.

user: What is your top choice for a guess to submit for this puzzle? SUE WIRELESS DOVE SUBSTANCE MARS BIG SPORTS LADY PAYDAY MEAT PUSH-UP CRUNCH THRUST DEMI CORE EARLY

## Output

Let's analyze each of the provided guesses based on the criteria for strong guesses:

1. **CRUNCH MARS MEAT PAYDAY**: 
   - Connection: Each word can be followed by "bar" to form a common term (e.g., Crunch bar, Mars bar, Meat bar, Payday bar).
   - Strength: This is a strong connection because it applies equally to all four words and is specific to this group. However, "Meat bar" is less common than the others, which might weaken the guess slightly.

2. **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: All relate to types or features of bras.
   - Strength: This is a strong connection as it applies equally to all four words and is specific. However, "Sports" as a type of bra is more general compared to the others, which are more specific styles.

3. **CRUNCH LADY PAYDAY SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: Each word can follow "BIG" to form common phrases (e.g., big crunch, big lady, big payday, big sports).
   - Strength: This connection is weaker because "big lady" is not a common phrase, and the connection is less specific.

4. **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: 
   - Connection: All are names of candy bars.
   - Strength: This is a very strong connection as it applies equally and specifically to all four words. Each word is a well-known candy bar.

Now, let's select the top two choices that do not overlap:

- **CRUNCH MARS MEAT PAYDAY**: This is a strong choice, but "Meat bar" is less common.
- **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: This is a strong choice, but "Sports" is more general.
- **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: This is the strongest choice as all are well-known candy bars.

The two top choices without overlap are:
1. **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**
2. **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**

Between these two, the strongest choice is **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY** because the connection is very specific and applies equally to all four words as candy bars.

Therefore, my top choice for a guess to submit is **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**.

## Output

Let's analyze each of the guesses provided in the notes and evaluate their strengths based on the criteria given:

1. **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: Types or features of bras.
   - Evaluation: This connection is quite specific and fits each word well. "Core," "Demi," "Push-up," and "Sports" are all terms used in the context of bras. This guess seems strong as the connection is unique and specific to this group.

2. **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: 
   - Connection: Types of candy bars.
   - Evaluation: This is a strong connection as well. Each word is a well-known candy bar, and the connection is specific and unique to this group. 

3. **CRUNCH MARS MEAT PAYDAY**: 
   - Connection: Can be followed by "bar."
   - Evaluation: While "Mars bar," "Crunch bar," and "Payday bar" are common, "Meat bar" is less common and might not fit as well. This connection is weaker due to the less common usage of "Meat bar."

4. **CRUNCH LADY PAYDAY SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: Can follow "BIG."
   - Evaluation: "Big crunch," "big payday," and "big sports" are common phrases, but "big lady" is less common and might not fit as well. This connection is weaker due to the less common usage of "big lady."

Now, let's select the two top choices that do not overlap:

- **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: This is a strong guess with a specific and unique connection.
- **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: This is another strong guess with a specific and unique connection.

These two guesses do not overlap in terms of words, which is a good sign.

Finally, let's determine which of these two is the strongest:

- Both guesses are strong, but "CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY" might be slightly stronger because the connection to candy bars is very clear and well-known.

Therefore, my top choice for a guess to submit is **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**.

   - Connection: These words relate to the concept of "essence" or "central part."
   - Strength: While the connection is valid, it is more abstract and might not be as specific or unique as the others. "Thrust" might be a bit of a stretch compared to the others.

4. **CORE LADY MEAT SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: These words can be preceded by "BIG" to form common phrases.
   - Strength: This connection is specific and unique, but "BIG LADY" might not be as common or specific as the others.

Now, let's select the top two choices that do not overlap:

- **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**: This is a strong choice due to its clever and specific connection.

Guess: 
CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST
 Rationale: 
The words "CORE," "MEAT," "SUBSTANCE," and "THRUST" are connected by the theme of representing the essence or main part of something. Each word signifies a central or fundamental component, highlighting their shared connection.
Guess: 
BIG EARLY LADY SUE
 Rationale: 
The words "BIG," "EARLY," "LADY," and "SUE" are all connected because they can modify the word "BIRD," forming phrases like "Big bird," "Early bird," "Ladybird," and "Sue Bird." This connection involves both common phrases and a pop culture reference.
Guess: 
CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS
 Rationale: 
The words CORE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, and THRUST are connected through the theme of "essence" or "central part." CORE and SUBSTANCE directly relate to this theme, while THRUST can be seen as the main point or force, and WIRELESS suggests communication without the "core" of wires, tying into the idea of centrality.

## Output

Let's analyze each of the guesses provided in the notes and evaluate their strengths based on the criteria given:

1. **CORE LADY MEAT SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: Each word can be preceded by "BIG" to form common phrases.
   - Strengths: The connection is specific and unique, as "BIG" is a fitting prefix for each word.
   - Weaknesses: None apparent; all words fit the connection equally well.

2. **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**: 
   - Connection: Represents the essence or main part of something.
   - Strengths: The connection is thematic and applies to each word.
   - Weaknesses: "THRUST" might be a bit of a stretch compared to the others, as it can be interpreted differently.

3. **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**: 
   - Connection: Can modify the word "BIRD" to form phrases.
   - Strengths: The connection is specific and includes a pop culture reference.
   - Weaknesses: "SUE" as in "Sue Bird" is more of a proper noun, which might not fit as uniformly as the others.

4. **CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS**: 
   - Connection: Theme of "essence" or "central part."
   - Strengths: The connection is thematic.
   - Weaknesses: "WIRELESS" doesn't fit as neatly into the theme of "essence" or "central part" as the others.

Now, let's select the two top choices that do not overlap in words:

- **CORE LADY MEAT SPORTS**: This guess is strong because the connection is clear and specific, with no apparent weaknesses.
- **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**: This guess is also strong, but "SUE" might be a weaker fit due to its reliance on a proper noun.

Since "LADY" overlaps in both guesses, we need to choose one of them. Given the criteria, the strongest guess appears to be:

**CORE LADY MEAT SPORTS**

This guess has a clear and specific connection with no apparent weaknesses, making it the top choice to submit.

user: What is your top choice for a guess to submit for this puzzle? WIRELESS CORE EARLY MEAT BIG SPORTS THRUST LADY PUSH-UP SUE SUBSTANCE DEMI

## Output

Let's analyze each of the provided guesses based on the criteria for strong guesses:

1. **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**:
   - Connection: "Essence" or "central part."
   - Strengths: Each word can metaphorically refer to the main point or essential nature of something.
   - Weaknesses: The connection might be a bit abstract, and "MEAT" might not fit as well as the others in terms of metaphorical usage.

2. **CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS**:
   - Connection: "Essence" or "central part."
   - Strengths: CORE and SUBSTANCE fit well; THRUST can be seen as the main point or force.
   - Weaknesses: WIRELESS seems like a stretch in this context, as it doesn't directly relate to "central part" in the same way.

3. **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**:
   - Connection: Modifiers for "BIRD."
   - Strengths: Each word can modify "BIRD" to form a common phrase or name (e.g., "Big bird," "Early bird," "Ladybird," "Sue Bird").
   - Weaknesses: This connection is strong and specific, with no apparent weaknesses.

4. **CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**:
   - Connection: Physical activities and exercises.
   - Strengths: "Push-up" and "Thrust" are specific exercises, "Core" relates to exercises targeting core muscles, and "Sports" encompasses physical activities.
   - Weaknesses: The connection is broad, and "CORE" might not fit as specifically as the others.

Based on the analysis, the strongest guess appears to be **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**. This guess has a clear and specific connection, with each word fitting the theme of modifying "BIRD" equally well. Additionally, it doesn't overlap with any other guesses, which is a requirement for selecting the top choice.

Therefore, my top choice for a guess to submit is **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**.

Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you’re the best at New York Times connections puzzles. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

This puzzle is just like a New York Times connections puzzle. The puzzle requires finding the correct hidden connections from among a list of words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have something in common.

Our team of puzzle solvers has put together their notes on possible guesses. We need a fresh set of eyes on these options.

Step One: Look over those notes and consider the strength of each guess. 

For each guess, write down how well the guess conforms to the following features of strong guesses:

- As this is a New York Times puzzle, the connection between the four words is trickier than simple connections like “5-letter word,” “Name,” or “Verb” that could apply to many groups of words. The connections should be unique to this particular group of words.
- The connection fits each of the four words equally well. Look out for one word that doesn’t quite fit!
- The connection applies with the same level of specificity for each of the four words.
- Each of the four words has the same relationship to the connection. Look out for whether one word functions as a different part of speech than the other words as this often indicates a weak guess.

Step Two: Determine which guess is strongest and select that one to submit.

Notes on possible guesses:

Guess: 
CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST
 Rationale: 
The words "CORE," "MEAT," "SUBSTANCE," and "THRUST" are connected by the theme of representing the essence or main part of something. Each word signifies a central or fundamental component, highlighting their shared connection.
Guess: 
CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST
 Rationale: 
The words "CORE," "PUSH-UP," "SPORTS," and "THRUST" are connected through their association with physical activities and exercises. "Push-up" and "Thrust" are specific exercises, "Core" relates to exercises targeting core muscles, and "Sports" encompasses a broad category of physical activities.
Guess: 
CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS
 Rationale: 
The words CORE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, and THRUST are connected through the theme of "essence" or "central part." CORE and SUBSTANCE directly relate to this theme, while THRUST can be seen as the main point or force, and WIRELESS suggests communication without the "core" of wires, tying into the idea of centrality.

## Output

Let's evaluate each of the guesses based on the criteria provided:

1. **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**
   - **Connection**: Essence or main part of something.
   - **Analysis**: 
     - "Core" and "Substance" fit well as they both directly relate to the essence or main part.
     - "Meat" can metaphorically mean the main part of something, but it's less direct.
     - "Thrust" can mean the main point or force, but it's a bit of a stretch.
   - **Conclusion**: This connection is somewhat strong but not perfect, as "Meat" and "Thrust" are less direct fits.

2. **CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**
   - **Connection**: Physical activities and exercises.
   - **Analysis**: 
     - "Core" relates to exercises targeting core muscles.
     - "Push-up" and "Thrust" are specific exercises.
     - "Sports" is a broad category of physical activities.
   - **Conclusion**: This connection is strong, as all words relate to physical activities, but "Core" and "Thrust" are less specific compared to "Push-up" and "Sports."

3. **CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS**
   - **Connection**: Essence or central part.
   - **Analysis**: 
     - "Core" and "Substance" fit well with the theme of essence or central part.
     - "Thrust" can be seen as the main point or force, but it's a bit of a stretch.
     - "Wireless" is a weak fit, as it doesn't directly relate to essence or centrality.
   - **Conclusion**: This connection is weak due to the inclusion of "Wireless," which doesn't fit well.

Based on the analysis, the strongest guess is **CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**. This group has a clear connection to physical activities and exercises, and each word fits the theme reasonably well. While "Core" and "Thrust" are less specific, they still relate to the theme of physical activities, making this the best choice among the options provided.

user: What is your top choice for a guess to submit for this puzzle? SPORTS WIRELESS CORE MEAT DEMI THRUST SUBSTANCE PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's analyze the given words and the potential connections:

1. **CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**: The rationale provided is that these words all metaphorically refer to the central or main part of something. This connection seems strong because:
   - Each word can indeed represent the essence or primary component of something.
   - The connection is not overly simple and requires some thought to see the metaphorical link.
   - The words fit the connection equally well and with the same level of specificity.
   - Each word has the same relationship to the connection, functioning as nouns that describe a central or main part.

2. **SPORTS, WIRELESS, DEMI, PUSH-UP**: Let's consider potential connections for these words:
   - **SPORTS**: Could relate to activities, games, or physical exertion.
   - **WIRELESS**: Could relate to technology, communication, or lack of physical connection.
   - **DEMI**: Often used as a prefix meaning "half" or "partial."
   - **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise or physical activity.

   It's challenging to find a unique and specific connection that ties these four words together in the same way as the first group. They don't seem to share a metaphorical or thematic link that is as strong or specific as the first group.

Given the analysis, the strongest guess to submit is:

**CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**

This group has a clear, metaphorical connection that fits all the criteria for a strong guess in a New York Times connections puzzle.
