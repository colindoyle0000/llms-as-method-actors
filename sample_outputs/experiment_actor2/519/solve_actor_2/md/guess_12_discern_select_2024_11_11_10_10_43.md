You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's evaluate the notes and the words provided to determine if we should submit a guess.

From the notes, we have two strong potential solutions:

1. **EARLY, BIG, LADY, SUE** - These words can all modify "BIRD": "Early bird," "Big bird," "Ladybird," and "Sue Bird." This connection is strong and unique, involving both common phrases and a pop culture reference.

2. **DEMI, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, WIRELESS** - These words are all types of bras: "Demi-cup bra," "Sports bra," "Push-up bra," and "Wireless bra." This connection is also strong and consistent.

Given the list of words you provided: PUSH-UP, EARLY, LADY, SPORTS, BIG, SUE, WIRELESS, DEMI, we can see that both of these potential solutions are present.

However, the notes suggest that the connection with "BIRD" (EARLY, BIG, LADY, SUE) is particularly unique and clever, making it slightly more compelling.

Therefore, based on the notes and the evaluation, I recommend submitting the guess for **EARLY, BIG, LADY, SUE** as words that can all modify "BIRD." This is a strong and unique connection that fits well with the puzzle's requirements./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
