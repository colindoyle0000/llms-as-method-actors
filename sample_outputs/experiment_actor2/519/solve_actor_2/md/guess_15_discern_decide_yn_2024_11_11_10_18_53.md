## Prompts

system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's evaluate the possible guesses from the notes and see which one is the strongest:

1. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST**:
   - **Explanation**: These words are suggested to be synonymous adjectives in the sense of being essential or central. "Core" and "substance" can mean central or essential, "meaty" can mean substantial or significant, and "thrust" can imply a central or main point.
   - **Analysis**: This connection seems plausible as each word can relate to the idea of being central or essential. The words fit well together in this context.

2. **DEMI, SUBSTANCE, WIRELESS, PUSH-UP**:
   - **Explanation**: These words all have two syllables, which is a potential pattern based on syllable count.
   - **Analysis**: While this is a valid observation, the connection based on syllable count is quite generic and not as strong or unique as the first guess. The connection doesn't provide a deeper or more specific relationship between the words.

Given the analysis, the first guess, **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST**, seems to be the strongest viable option. It provides a specific and meaningful connection between the words, which aligns with the guidelines for solving the puzzle.

**Top Choice for Submission**: CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST

Since the notes indicate that the guess "CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS" was incorrect, we should avoid submitting any guess that includes those words together. 

Based on the analysis, the strongest guess to submit is **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST**. This guess has a specific and meaningful connection, making it a strong candidate for submission. 

Let's submit **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST** as the answer for this puzzle.
