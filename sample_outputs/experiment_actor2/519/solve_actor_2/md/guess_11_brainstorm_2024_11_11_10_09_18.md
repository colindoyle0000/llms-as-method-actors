Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous adjectives.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “wee”: DINKY LITTLE MINUTE SLIGHT
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “primary”: CHIEF FIRST MAIN PRINCIPAL
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “gentle”: LIGHT MELLOW MILD SOFT
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “absolute”: PURE SHEER TOTAL UTTER
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “indecent”: BAWDY BLUE COARSE RISQUE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE THRUST MEAT LADY SUE CORE WIRELESS PUSH-UP SPORTS BIG EARLY DEMI

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, following the instructions provided.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words That Can Be Synonymous Adjectives

1. **SUBSTANCE**: This word can be an adjective in the sense of "substantial" or "having substance."
2. **CORE**: This word can be an adjective meaning "central" or "essential."

Both "substantial" and "essential" can be synonymous in certain contexts, as they both imply something fundamental or important.

### Step 2: See If Other Puzzle Words Can Also Be Synonymous

Let's examine the other words to see if they can fit into this pattern:

3. **MEAT**: This can be an adjective in the sense of "meaty," which can mean "substantial" or "having substance."
4. **THRUST**: This is a bit tricky, but "thrust" can imply "main point" or "core idea," which aligns with "central" or "essential."

### Group of Four Puzzle Words

Based on the analysis above, we can propose the following group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives:

- **SUBSTANCE** (substantial)
- **CORE** (central, essential)
- **MEAT** (meaty, substantial)
- **THRUST** (main point, core)

These words can all be used as adjectives to describe something that is fundamental, important, or substantial in nature.

If this doesn't seem to fit the pattern, we can try another approach or look for a different set of synonyms. Let me know if you want to explore further!

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding synonyms that function as the same part of speech.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms.**

1. **PUSH-UP and THRUST**: Both can function as verbs meaning "to exert force" or "to push forward."

2. **BIG and CORE**: These don't seem to be synonyms, so let's try another pair.

3. **EARLY and DEMI**: These don't seem to be synonyms either.

4. **LADY and DEMI**: These don't seem to be synonyms either.

5. **WIRELESS and SUBSTANCE**: These don't seem to be synonyms either.

6. **SUE and DEMI**: These don't seem to be synonyms either.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.**

Let's focus on the first pair we identified: **PUSH-UP and THRUST**.

- **SPORTS**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **BIG**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **CORE**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.

Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same set of letters

Steps to take: 

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm letters or words that can follow each word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular sets of letters or words rather than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “berry”: BLUE GOOSE RASP STRAW
Puzzle words that are each followed by “land countries”: ICE IRE FIN NETHER
Puzzle words that are each followed by “-o”: DADDY DAY JACKIE JELL

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same set of letters or words that can follow them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular sets of letters or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words. 

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have that same set of letters or word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same set of letters or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BOAT BLUE CAR PLANE STRAW TRANSPORTATION PINCH DASH GAME GOOSE RASP IN ON BOARD DROP SPLASH DOWN

Output:

Let’s examine the list of words provided to see what set of letters commonly follow these words, then identify words that have the same letters that commonly follow them:

**Step 1: Identify letters that follow these puzzle words**

**BOAT** - house, yard, load, race

**BLUE** - berry, print, jay, tooth

**CAR** - pet, pool, port, bon

**PLANE** - tarium, trees, tary, table

**STRAW** - berry, man, bale, hat

**TRANSPORTATION** - al, infrastructure, system, sector

**PINCH** - ed, ing, point, hit

**DASH** - board, ing, ed, line

**GAME** - play, board, plan, master

**GOOSE** - berry, bump, neck, flesh

**RASP** - berry, ing, ed, er

**IN** - side, to, put, come

**ON** - line, ward, going, to

**BOARD** - room, walk, game, ing

**DROP** - let, down, out, box

**SPLASH** - ing, ed, down, page

**DOWN** - load, town, ward, pour

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same letters that commonly follow them**

1. **BLUE** - berry
2. **GOOSE** - berry
3. **RASP** - berry
4. **STRAW** - berry

These puzzle words are all commonly followed by "berry.”

**Step: 3 See if other puzzle words on the list can have the same letters follow them**

Already found four words followed by “berry”

1. **BLUE** - berry
2. **GOOSE** - berry
3. **RASP** - berry
4. **STRAW** - berry

— end of example input and output —


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI MEAT SUE WIRELESS LADY SUBSTANCE SPORTS PUSH-UP BIG CORE EARLY THRUST

## Output

Let's go through the steps to identify a possible solution to this puzzle.

**Step 1: Identify letters or words that commonly follow these puzzle words**

1. **DEMI** - god, moore, tasse, john
2. **MEAT** - ball, loaf, head, market
3. **SUE** - storm, ellen, happy, grafton
4. **WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, router
5. **LADY** - bug, bird, gaga, luck
6. **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, matter, control
7. **SPORTS** - car, center, bar, wear
8. **PUSH-UP** - bra, exercise, challenge, position
9. **BIG** - ben, bang, apple, deal
10. **CORE** - strength, value, group, temperature
11. **EARLY** - bird, riser, adopter, morning
12. **THRUST** - vector, stage, force, bearing

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same letters or words that commonly follow them**

Let's look for a common set of letters or words that can follow these puzzle words:

- **LADY** - bug
- **EARLY** - bird
- **SPORTS** - car
- **BIG** - ben

These words don't seem to have a common set of letters or words that follow them. Let's try another approach.

- **DEMI** - god
- **LADY** - gaga
- **BIG** - ben
- **EARLY** - bird

These words also don't seem to have a common set of letters or words that follow them. Let's try another approach.

- **MEAT** - ball
- **SPORTS** - car
- **WIRELESS** - network
- **SUBSTANCE** - abuse

These words also don't seem to have a common set of letters or words that follow them. Let's try another approach.

- **PUSH-UP** - bra
- **CORE** - strength
- **THRUST** - vector
- **WIRELESS** - router

These words also don't seem to have a common set of letters or words that follow them. Let's try another approach.

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have the same letters follow them**

After examining the list, it seems that none of the words can be grouped into a set of four that share a common set of letters or words that follow them. 

If you have any other ideas or patterns to explore, let me know, and we can try another approach.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are different aspects of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. Describe the connection between the puzzle words as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Words that are each different aspects of the sharpness as of an image: CLARITY DEFINITION DETAIL RESOLUTION
Words that are each different aspects of plant growths: BLOOM BUD SHOOT SPROUT
Words that are each different aspects of bee creations: COMB HIVE HONEY WAX
Words that are each different aspects of movie summary info: CAST GENRE PLOT TITLE
Words that are each different aspects of sheet music: CLEF NOTE REST STAFF
Words that are each different aspects of solar emanations: CORONA FLARE LIGHT RADIATION

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be different aspects of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing, start over at Step 1.



If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE CORE THRUST EARLY WIRELESS SPORTS DEMI SUE LADY PUSH-UP BIG MEAT

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, looking for connections between the words that might indicate they are different aspects of the same thing.

1. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to the material or essence of something.

2. **CORE**: This often refers to the central or most important part of something.

3. **THRUST**: This can refer to the main point or essence of an argument or action, or the force applied to move something.

4. **EARLY**: This could refer to the beginning or initial stage of something.

5. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without physical connections, often related to communication.

6. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games, often competitive.

7. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half or partial, often used in contexts like "demigod" or "demitasse."

8. **SUE**: This refers to the act of bringing a legal action against someone.

9. **LADY**: This refers to a woman, often with connotations of respect or nobility.

10. **PUSH-UP**: This is a physical exercise.

11. **BIG**: This refers to size or importance.

12. **MEAT**: This refers to the flesh of animals used as food, or metaphorically, the substance or core of an argument.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, THRUST**: These words can all relate to the essence or main part of something. "Substance" and "core" are directly related to the central part or essence. "Meat" can be used metaphorically to describe the main part of an argument or discussion. "Thrust" can refer to the main point or driving force behind an argument or action.

This group seems to fit the pattern of being different aspects of the same thing, specifically the essence or main part of something.

If this solution seems plausible, we can consider it as a potential answer. If not, we can continue to explore other combinations. Let me know if you want to explore further or if this solution works for you.

This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle pop culture references are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious pop culture references. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words share a pop culture reference.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the name of jazz legends: HANCOCK HOLIDAY MONK PARKER
Puzzle words that are each last names of superheroes: BANNER PRINCE STARK WAYNE
Puzzle words that are each TV shows with happy-sounding names: CHEERS EUPHORIA FELICITY GLEE
Puzzle words that are each things in “my favorite things”: KETTLES MITTENS RAINDROPS WHISKERS

Puzzle words that are each the last name of a pop megastar: GRANDE MARS STYLES SWIFT
Puzzle words that are each rooms in the game clue: HALL LIBRARY LOUNGE STUDY
Puzzle words that are each lands at Disneyland: ADVENTURE FANTASY FRONTIER TOMORROW

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by sharing the same pop culture reference. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential pop culture references that could connect four of these words.

1. **PUSH-UP**: This could refer to a type of exercise or a type of bra. In pop culture, it might be associated with fitness or fashion.

2. **MEAT**: This could refer to food, but in pop culture, it might be associated with "Meat Loaf," the rock musician, or "Meat" from the movie "Rocky."

3. **LADY**: This could refer to "Lady Gaga," a pop megastar, or "My Fair Lady," a famous musical.

4. **DEMI**: This could refer to "Demi Lovato," a pop singer, or "Demi Moore," an actress.

5. **SPORTS**: This could refer to athletics in general, or it might be associated with "Sports Illustrated," a famous magazine.

6. **THRUST**: This could refer to a physical action, but in pop culture, it might be associated with "Thrust" from the Transformers series.

7. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to technology, like wireless internet, or it might be associated with "Wireless Festival," a music festival.

8. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something, or in pop culture, it might be associated with "Core" from the video game series "Dead Space."

9. **EARLY**: This could refer to time, but in pop culture, it might be associated with "Early Edition," a TV show.

10. **BIG**: This could refer to size, or in pop culture, it might be associated with "Big" the movie starring Tom Hanks, or "Notorious B.I.G.," the rapper.

11. **SUE**: This could refer to a legal action, or in pop culture, it might be associated with "Sue Sylvester," a character from the TV show "Glee."

12. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to material, or in pop culture, it might be associated with "Substance," a compilation album by New Order.

Now, let's try to find a group of four words that share a pop culture reference:

- **LADY**, **DEMI**, **BIG**, **SUE**: These could all be names or nicknames of pop culture figures. "Lady" for Lady Gaga, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, "Big" for Notorious B.I.G., and "Sue" for Sue Sylvester from "Glee."

This group seems to fit the pattern of being names or nicknames of pop culture figures. Let's go with this combination as a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another approach.
