Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that share a pop culture reference

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle pop culture references are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious pop culture references. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words share a pop culture reference.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the name of jazz legends: HANCOCK HOLIDAY MONK PARKER
Puzzle words that are each last names of superheroes: BANNER PRINCE STARK WAYNE
Puzzle words that are each TV shows with happy-sounding names: CHEERS EUPHORIA FELICITY GLEE
Puzzle words that are each things in “my favorite things”: KETTLES MITTENS RAINDROPS WHISKERS
Puzzle words that are each the name of an NBA team player: CLIPPER PACER ROCKET SPUR
Puzzle words that are each the name of a famous guitarist: BERRY KING PAGE WATERS
Puzzle words that are each the name of a famous poem: DADDY HARLEM HOWL IF
Puzzle words that are each the last name of a pop megastar: GRANDE MARS STYLES SWIFT
Puzzle words that are each rooms in the game clue: HALL LIBRARY LOUNGE STUDY
Puzzle words that are each lands at Disneyland: ADVENTURE FANTASY FRONTIER TOMORROW

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by sharing the same pop culture reference. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CORE SUE THRUST DOVE DEMI SUBSTANCE MEAT PUSH-UP WIRELESS PAYDAY MARS LADY EARLY BIG SPORTS CRUNCH

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential pop culture references among the puzzle words.

1. **CORE**: This could refer to "Apple Core," a play on the tech company Apple, or perhaps the "core" of a team or group in sports or entertainment.

2. **SUE**: This could refer to "Sue Storm," a character from the Fantastic Four, or "Sue Sylvester," a character from the TV show "Glee."

3. **THRUST**: This might relate to a concept in science fiction or action movies, such as "thrust" in space travel.

4. **DOVE**: This could refer to the soap brand, or perhaps the song "When Doves Cry" by Prince.

5. **DEMI**: This could refer to Demi Lovato or Demi Moore, both well-known figures in pop culture.

6. **SUBSTANCE**: This might relate to the phrase "substance over style," or perhaps a song or album title.

7. **MEAT**: This could refer to "Meat Loaf," the musician, or perhaps a reference to "meat" in a culinary or cultural context.

8. **PUSH-UP**: This might relate to fitness culture or a specific brand or product.

9. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to wireless technology, or perhaps a song or album title.

10. **PAYDAY**: This could refer to the candy bar, or perhaps a movie or song title.

11. **MARS**: This could refer to Bruno Mars, the musician, or the planet Mars, which is often referenced in science fiction.

12. **LADY**: This could refer to "Lady Gaga," or perhaps "Lady and the Tramp," the Disney movie.

13. **EARLY**: This might relate to a phrase or concept, such as "early bird," or a song or album title.

14. **BIG**: This could refer to the movie "Big" starring Tom Hanks, or perhaps "Notorious B.I.G.," the rapper.

15. **SPORTS**: This could refer to the general category of sports, or perhaps a specific sports team or event.

16. **CRUNCH**: This could refer to the candy bar, or perhaps a fitness brand or concept.

Now, let's try to find a group of four words that share a pop culture reference:

- **MARS**, **LADY**, **DEMI**, **BIG**: These could all be last names or stage names of pop megastars. Mars (Bruno Mars), Lady (Lady Gaga), Demi (Demi Lovato), Big (Notorious B.I.G.).

This seems like a plausible group that fits the pattern of pop culture references. If this doesn't work, we can explore other combinations or patterns. Let me know if you want to try another approach!

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can mean the same thing. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can mean the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can mean the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “how fast something is going”: CLIP PACE RATE SPEED
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to fail to attend”: CUT DITCH MISS SKIP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to become aware of”: DISCOVER FIND LEARN REALIZE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to apply pressure to”: CRUSH MASH PRESS SQUASH
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to chat informally”: GAB JAW YAK YAP
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “pretense”: AFFECT AIRS CHARADE FRONT
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “foolishness”: ABSURDITY FOLLY MADNESS NONSENSE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to move forward”: ADVANCE MARCH PROGRESS PUSH
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to get smaller”: CONTRACT LESSEN REDUCE SHRINK
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to criticize”: BLAST KNOCK SLAM TRASH

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also mean the same thing as the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can mean the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CORE DOVE PUSH-UP MARS SUBSTANCE SPORTS DEMI LADY BIG CRUNCH WIRELESS THRUST PAYDAY MEAT SUE EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding words that can mean the same thing and function as the same part of speech.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words That Can Mean the Same Thing

1. **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can be nouns meaning the essential part or essence of something.
2. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can be verbs meaning to push or drive forward with force.
3. **BIG** and **LADY**: This is a bit of a stretch, but if we consider "big" as an adjective meaning important or significant, and "lady" as a noun meaning a woman of importance, there might be a connection, though it's not strong.
4. **CRUNCH** and **THRUST**: Both can be verbs meaning to apply force or pressure, though in different contexts.

### Step 2: See If Other Puzzle Words Can Also Mean the Same Thing

Let's explore the first pair, **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**, and see if other words fit:

- **CORE**: Essential part, essence.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Essential part, essence.

Looking at the list, none of the other words seem to fit this specific meaning.

Let's try the second pair, **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**:

- **THRUST**: To push or drive forward with force.
- **PUSH-UP**: To push upward, though typically a noun for an exercise, it can imply a forceful upward motion.

Other words that might fit:
- **CRUNCH**: To apply force or pressure, often in a decisive or forceful manner.
- **WIRELESS**: This doesn't fit the pattern.

Let's try another pair, **CRUNCH** and **THRUST**:

- **CRUNCH**: To apply force or pressure.
- **THRUST**: To push or drive forward with force.

Other words that might fit:
- **PUSH-UP**: As discussed, can imply a forceful motion.
- **SUE**: This doesn't fit the pattern.

### Conclusion

The strongest connection seems to be between **THRUST**, **PUSH-UP**, and **CRUNCH** as verbs related to applying force or pressure. However, we need a fourth word to complete the set, and none of the remaining words fit this pattern precisely.

If we can't find a fourth word, we might need to consider a different pattern or request additional puzzle words to work with. Let me know if you want to explore another pattern or need further assistance.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can each be a part of a different word within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories. As precisely as possible, describe how each of the two puzzle words can be part of a different word within the same category.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the first letters of a zodiac sign: CAN GEM LIB TAU
Puzzle words that are each the first letters of the name of a planet: EAR MAR MER SAT
Puzzle words that each start with letters that form the name of a rock band: CREAMSICLE JOURNEYMAN KISSCAM RUSHMORE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can be part of different words within that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CRUNCH SUE PUSH-UP BIG DOVE PAYDAY THRUST DEMI MEAT WIRELESS MARS LADY CORE SPORTS EARLY SUBSTANCE

## Output

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We need to identify a category where each puzzle word can be part of a different word within that category. Let's start by examining the list of words:

1. CRUNCH
2. SUE
3. PUSH-UP
4. BIG
5. DOVE
6. PAYDAY
7. THRUST
8. DEMI
9. MEAT
10. WIRELESS
11. MARS
12. LADY
13. CORE
14. SPORTS
15. EARLY
16. SUBSTANCE

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

Let's start by identifying two words that can be part of a different word within the same category. 

- **MARS**: This could be part of the category "Planets" (e.g., Mars is a planet).
- **EARLY**: This could be part of the category "Times of Day" (e.g., early morning).

These two don't match a category yet, so let's keep looking.

### Step 2: Explore Other Words

Let's try another approach by looking for more specific categories:

- **CRUNCH**: Could be part of "Exercise Moves" (e.g., crunches).
- **PUSH-UP**: Also fits "Exercise Moves" (e.g., push-ups).

This seems promising. Let's see if we can find more words in this category:

- **THRUST**: Could be part of "Exercise Moves" (e.g., hip thrusts).
- **CORE**: Could be part of "Exercise Moves" (e.g., core exercises).

### Step 3: Verify the Category

We have identified four words that fit the category "Exercise Moves":
1. CRUNCH
2. PUSH-UP
3. THRUST
4. CORE

These words can all be part of different exercise moves, which fits the pattern of being parts of different words within the same category.

### Conclusion

The group of four words that match the pattern is:
- CRUNCH
- PUSH-UP
- THRUST
- CORE

This solution fits the pattern of being parts of different words within the category "Exercise Moves." Let me know if you need further assistance or if we should explore another pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each modify the same word

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that each puzzle word can modify. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words rather than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each modify “pepper”: BELL BLACK DR GHOST
Puzzle words that each modify “trap”: BEAR SAND SPEED TOURIST
Puzzle words that each modify “hour”: AMATEUR ELEVENTH HAPPY RUSH
Puzzle words that each modify “dream”: AMERICAN FEVER LUCID PIPE
Puzzle words that each modify “bat”: BASEBALL CRICKET FRUIT VAMPIRE

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can each modify the same word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so a unique and particular word being modified is more likely to be correct than a generic and ubiquitous word.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can modify that same word. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each modify the same word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that each modify the same word, start over at Step 2.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are each a kind of the same thing. 

1. **CRUNCH**: This could refer to a type of exercise (abdominal crunch), a type of sound, or even a type of candy bar (Nestlé Crunch).

2. **PAYDAY**: This is a type of candy bar.

3. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something, a type of exercise (core workout), or even a type of apple core.

4. **MEAT**: This is a general term for food, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

5. **MARS**: This could refer to the planet, but more relevantly, it's a type of candy bar (Mars bar).

6. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a general term and doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

7. **THRUST**: This could refer to a type of force or movement, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

8. **EARLY**: This is a descriptor of time and doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

9. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to technology, such as wireless internet or wireless devices.

10. **DOVE**: This could refer to a type of bird or a brand of chocolate (Dove chocolate).

11. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.

13. **LADY**: This could refer to a type of person or a title, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

14. **DEMI**: This could refer to a prefix meaning "half" or a name, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

15. **BIG**: This is a descriptor of size and doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

16. **SPORTS**: This is a general term for physical activities, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

Now, let's see if we can find a group of four words that are each a kind of the same thing:

- **Candy Bars**: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE

These four words all refer to types of candy bars. This seems to be a strong connection, as they all fit the pattern of being a kind of candy bar.
