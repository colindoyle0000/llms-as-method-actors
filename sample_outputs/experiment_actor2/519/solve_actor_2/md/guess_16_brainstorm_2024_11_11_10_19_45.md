Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to follow”: SHADOW TAIL TRACK TRAIL
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to come down to rest”: PERCH ROOST SETTLE LAND
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “something easy to do”: BREEZE CINCH PICNIC SNAP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to wrap around in a circle”: COIL SPIRAL TWIST WIND
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to jump into the air”: BOUND LEAP SPRING VAULT
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to decline”: EBB FADE FLAG WANE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to express”: AIR SPEAK STATE VOICE
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “enormous”: BIG GIANT GREAT HUGE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to connect”: COUPLE HITCH LINK TIE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to restrict”: CAP CHECK CURB LIMIT

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 The following guesses were incorrect: 
CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SPORTS MEAT CORE WIRELESS PUSH-UP DEMI THRUST SUBSTANCE

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on finding synonyms among the puzzle words.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words That Can Be Synonyms

1. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can function as verbs meaning "to push" or "to propel." However, "push-up" is more specific to an exercise, so this might not be the best pair.

2. **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can function as nouns meaning "the essential part" or "the main component." This seems like a promising pair.

3. **WIRELESS** and **DEMI**: These don't seem to have a direct synonym relationship.

4. **SPORTS** and **MEAT**: These don't seem to have a direct synonym relationship.

### Step 2: Expand to Four Puzzle Words

Let's focus on the promising pair: **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**.

- **CORE**: Can mean the central or most important part.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Can mean the essential nature or most important part.

Now, let's see if we can find two more words that fit this pattern:

1. **ESSENCE**: This isn't in the list, but it would fit the pattern if it were.
2. **NUB**: This isn't in the list, but it would fit the pattern if it were.

Unfortunately, none of the remaining words (SPORTS, MEAT, WIRELESS, PUSH-UP, DEMI, THRUST) seem to fit the pattern of being synonymous with "core" and "substance."

### Conclusion

It seems like we can't find four words from the given list that fit the pattern of being synonymous with "core" and "substance." We might need to consider a different pattern or look for other potential synonyms among the words.

Let's try another approach or pattern if you have any other ideas or if we should consider a different set of synonyms.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same set of letters

Steps to take: 

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm letters or words that can follow each word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular sets of letters or words rather than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “berry”: BLUE GOOSE RASP STRAW
Puzzle words that are each followed by “land countries”: ICE IRE FIN NETHER
Puzzle words that are each followed by “-o”: DADDY DAY JACKIE JELL

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same set of letters or words that can follow them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular sets of letters or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words. 

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have that same set of letters or word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same set of letters or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BOAT BLUE CAR PLANE STRAW TRANSPORTATION PINCH DASH GAME GOOSE RASP IN ON BOARD DROP SPLASH DOWN

Output:

Let’s examine the list of words provided to see what set of letters commonly follow these words, then identify words that have the same letters that commonly follow them:

**Step 1: Identify letters that follow these puzzle words**

**BOAT** - house, yard, load, race

**BLUE** - berry, print, jay, tooth

**CAR** - pet, pool, port, bon

**PLANE** - tarium, trees, tary, table

**STRAW** - berry, man, bale, hat

**TRANSPORTATION** - al, infrastructure, system, sector

**PINCH** - ed, ing, point, hit

**DASH** - board, ing, ed, line

**GAME** - play, board, plan, master

**GOOSE** - berry, bump, neck, flesh

**RASP** - berry, ing, ed, er

**IN** - side, to, put, come

**ON** - line, ward, going, to

**BOARD** - room, walk, game, ing

**DROP** - let, down, out, box

**SPLASH** - ing, ed, down, page

**DOWN** - load, town, ward, pour

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same letters that commonly follow them**

1. **BLUE** - berry
2. **GOOSE** - berry
3. **RASP** - berry
4. **STRAW** - berry

These puzzle words are all commonly followed by "berry.”

**Step: 3 See if other puzzle words on the list can have the same letters follow them**

Already found four words followed by “berry”

1. **BLUE** - berry
2. **GOOSE** - berry
3. **RASP** - berry
4. **STRAW** - berry

— end of example input and output —

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE SPORTS THRUST MEAT DEMI CORE WIRELESS PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's go through the steps to identify a possible solution for the puzzle using the provided words: SUBSTANCE, SPORTS, THRUST, MEAT, DEMI, CORE, WIRELESS, PUSH-UP.

**Step 1: Identify letters or words that commonly follow these puzzle words**

1. **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, control, dual
2. **SPORTS** - car, wear, man, field
3. **THRUST** - er, ing, ed, force
4. **MEAT** - ball, loaf, head, market
5. **DEMI** - god, tasse, john, monde
6. **CORE** - strength, value, team, temperature
7. **WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, access
8. **PUSH-UP** - bra, exercise, position, challenge

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same letters or words that commonly follow them**

Let's look for a common set of letters or words that can follow four of these puzzle words:

- **DEMI** - god
- **CORE** - strength
- **WIRELESS** - network
- **PUSH-UP** - bra

None of these seem to have a common set of letters or words that follow them. Let's try another approach.

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have the same letters follow them**

Let's try to find another pattern:

- **SUBSTANCE** - abuse
- **SPORTS** - car
- **THRUST** - er
- **MEAT** - ball

These words don't seem to have a common set of letters or words that follow them either.

Let's try another pattern:

- **DEMI** - tasse
- **CORE** - team
- **WIRELESS** - access
- **PUSH-UP** - challenge

Again, no common set of letters or words.

It seems like we might need to try another pattern or set of words. If you have any other ideas or words to try, let me know!

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are different aspects of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. Describe the connection between the puzzle words as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Words that are each different aspects of the sharpness as of an image: CLARITY DEFINITION DETAIL RESOLUTION
Words that are each different aspects of plant growths: BLOOM BUD SHOOT SPROUT
Words that are each different aspects of bee creations: COMB HIVE HONEY WAX
Words that are each different aspects of movie summary info: CAST GENRE PLOT TITLE
Words that are each different aspects of sheet music: CLEF NOTE REST STAFF
Words that are each different aspects of solar emanations: CORONA FLARE LIGHT RADIATION

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be different aspects of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI THRUST SPORTS PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE MEAT CORE WIRELESS

## Output

Let's start by examining the words and looking for connections between them. We need to find four words that are different aspects of the same thing. 

1. **DEMI**: This could refer to something that is half or partial.
2. **THRUST**: This could relate to force or movement.
3. **SPORTS**: This is a broad category that includes various physical activities.
4. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.
5. **SUBSTANCE**: This refers to a material or matter.
6. **MEAT**: This is a type of food, specifically animal flesh.
7. **CORE**: This can refer to the central or most important part of something.
8. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without physical connections.

Let's try to find connections:

- **CORE** and **THRUST**: Both can relate to the central or essential part of something, especially in terms of energy or force.
- **PUSH-UP** and **SPORTS**: Both relate to physical activity or exercise.
- **SUBSTANCE** and **MEAT**: Both can refer to material or matter, though in different contexts.

Now, let's see if we can find a group of four words that are different aspects of the same thing:

1. **CORE**: Central part or essential aspect.
2. **THRUST**: Force or movement, possibly related to the core in terms of energy.
3. **PUSH-UP**: Exercise that can strengthen the core.
4. **SPORTS**: Activities that often involve exercises like push-ups and require core strength.

These four words could potentially be different aspects of physical fitness or exercise. Let's consider this as a possible solution:

- **CORE**: Central strength in physical fitness.
- **THRUST**: Movement or force, often used in exercises.
- **PUSH-UP**: A specific exercise that targets the core.
- **SPORTS**: Activities that involve physical fitness and exercises.

This combination seems to fit the pattern of different aspects of physical fitness or exercise. Let's propose this as a possible solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another approach.

Pattern: Puzzle words that share a pop culture reference

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle pop culture references are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious pop culture references. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words share a pop culture reference.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the name of jazz legends: HANCOCK HOLIDAY MONK PARKER
Puzzle words that are each last names of superheroes: BANNER PRINCE STARK WAYNE
Puzzle words that are each TV shows with happy-sounding names: CHEERS EUPHORIA FELICITY GLEE
Puzzle words that are each things in “my favorite things”: KETTLES MITTENS RAINDROPS WHISKERS
Puzzle words that are each the name of an NBA team player: CLIPPER PACER ROCKET SPUR
Puzzle words that are each the name of a famous guitarist: BERRY KING PAGE WATERS
Puzzle words that are each the name of a famous poem: DADDY HARLEM HOWL IF
Puzzle words that are each the last name of a pop megastar: GRANDE MARS STYLES SWIFT
Puzzle words that are each rooms in the game clue: HALL LIBRARY LOUNGE STUDY
Puzzle words that are each lands at Disneyland: ADVENTURE FANTASY FRONTIER TOMORROW

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by sharing the same pop culture reference. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CORE MEAT DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST WIRELESS SUBSTANCE

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step and see if we can find a group of four words that share a pop culture reference.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words with a Pop Culture Reference

1. **CORE** and **DEMI**: 
   - "Demi" could refer to Demi Moore or Demi Lovato, both of whom are well-known figures in pop culture. "Core" might not directly connect to either of them, so let's set this aside for now.

2. **PUSH-UP** and **THRUST**:
   - Both words relate to physical movement or exercise, but they don't immediately suggest a specific pop culture reference.

3. **WIRELESS** and **SUBSTANCE**:
   - "Wireless" could relate to technology or music (e.g., "Wireless Festival"), but "Substance" doesn't immediately connect to a specific pop culture reference.

4. **MEAT** and **SPORTS**:
   - "Meat" could refer to Meat Loaf, the musician, but "Sports" doesn't directly connect to him.

### Step 2: Explore Other Connections

Let's try to find a more subtle or unique connection:

1. **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**:
   - Both words could relate to something fundamental or essential, but this is more of a thematic connection than a pop culture reference.

2. **DEMI** and **WIRELESS**:
   - "Demi" could refer to Demi Lovato, who is a musician. "Wireless" could relate to music festivals or streaming music, but this connection is tenuous.

3. **PUSH-UP** and **SPORTS**:
   - Both relate to fitness, but again, this is more thematic than a pop culture reference.

### Step 3: Try to Form a Group of Four

Let's see if we can find a group of four words that might share a pop culture reference:

- **CORE**, **THRUST**, **WIRELESS**, **SUBSTANCE**:
  - These words could relate to technology or innovation, but this is not a strong pop culture reference.

- **DEMI**, **MEAT**, **PUSH-UP**, **SPORTS**:
  - This combination doesn't seem to share a specific pop culture reference.

### Conclusion

I'm not seeing a clear group of four words that share a unique pop culture reference from this list. We might need to consider a different pattern or look for more subtle connections. If you have any additional context or clues, that might help us refine our approach. Otherwise, we may need to try another set of words or pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST DEMI MEAT SUBSTANCE CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS WIRELESS

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying words that can mean the same thing and function as the same part of speech.

1. **THRUST**: This can be a noun or a verb. As a verb, it means to push or drive with force. As a noun, it refers to a strong push or the main point of an argument.

2. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half or partial. It doesn't seem to fit well as a standalone word in this context.

3. **MEAT**: This is a noun, typically referring to the flesh of animals used as food. It can also mean the core or essential part of something.

4. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a noun, meaning the physical material from which something is made or the essential nature of something.

5. **CORE**: This is a noun, meaning the central or most important part of something.

6. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun, referring to a physical exercise. As a verb, it could mean to increase or raise something.

7. **SPORTS**: This is a noun, referring to physical activities or games.

8. **WIRELESS**: This is an adjective, referring to a system of communication that does not use wires.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **MEAT, SUBSTANCE, CORE**: These can all be nouns referring to the essential or central part of something. We need one more word to complete the set.

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP**: As verbs, they can both mean to push with force, but "push-up" is more commonly a noun in this context.

Let's focus on the nouns that mean the essential part:

- **MEAT, SUBSTANCE, CORE**: We need a fourth word that fits this pattern. "THRUST" as a noun doesn't quite fit this meaning. "WIRELESS" and "SPORTS" don't fit either.

Given the current list, it seems challenging to find a fourth word that fits the pattern of "essential part" among the provided words. We might need to consider a different pattern or additional words.

If you have any other ideas or want to explore a different angle, let me know!
