system: ""”

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 

Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We need to find a group of four words from the list that can substitute for each other, functioning as the same part of speech. 

1. **Identify potential connections:**

   - **SUBSTANCE**: Could be a noun meaning "essence" or "material."
   - **WIRELESS**: Could be an adjective meaning "without wires" or a noun referring to wireless technology.
   - **SUE**: Could be a verb meaning "to take legal action."
   - **THRUST**: Could be a verb meaning "to push forcefully" or a noun meaning "a strong push."
   - **CORE**: Could be a noun meaning "central part" or a verb meaning "to remove the core."
   - **LADY**: Could be a noun meaning "woman."
   - **PUSH-UP**: Could be a noun referring to an exercise.
   - **SPORTS**: Could be a noun referring to athletic activities or an adjective meaning "related to sports."
   - **BIG**: Could be an adjective meaning "large."
   - **MEAT**: Could be a noun meaning "flesh of an animal."
   - **EARLY**: Could be an adjective or adverb meaning "before the usual time."
   - **DEMI**: Could be an adjective meaning "half" or a prefix.

2. **Look for words that can substitute for each other:**

   Let's start by identifying two words that can substitute for each other:

   - **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can relate to a forceful movement or action. "Thrust" as a noun can mean a strong push, and "push-up" is a type of exercise involving pushing.

3. **Expand to four words:**

   - **THRUST**, **PUSH-UP**, **CORE**, **SPORTS**: These words can all relate to physical activity or exercise. "Thrust" and "push-up" are directly related to physical movements, "core" can refer to core exercises, and "sports" is a general term for physical activities.

4. **Verify the pattern:**

   - **THRUST**: As a noun, it can mean a strong push or drive, often used in physical contexts.
   - **PUSH-UP**: A noun referring to a physical exercise.
   - **CORE**: As a noun, it can refer to core exercises or the central part of something, often used in fitness.
   - **SPORTS**: As a noun, it refers to physical activities or exercises.

This group of words can substitute for each other in the context of physical activity or exercise, fitting the pattern of being nouns related to physical exertion or fitness. 

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can try another pattern or set of words. Let me know if you want to explore further!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, following the pattern of finding words that connect to different meanings of the same word or letter.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **CORE**: 
   - Core can refer to the central part of something, like the core of an apple.
   - It can also refer to the central or most important part of something, like the core of a problem.

2. **WIRELESS**:
   - Wireless can refer to technology that operates without physical wires, like Wi-Fi.
   - It can also refer to a radio or communication system that doesn't use wires.

### Step 2: Find Other Words

Let's see if we can find other words that connect to different meanings of the same word or letter.

3. **SUBSTANCE**:
   - Substance can refer to a particular kind of matter with uniform properties, like a chemical substance.
   - It can also refer to the essence or most important part of something, like the substance of an argument.

4. **THRUST**:
   - Thrust can refer to the force that propels something forward, like the thrust of a rocket.
   - It can also refer to the main point or essence of an argument, like the thrust of a speech.

### Group of Four Words

- **CORE**: Central part or essence.
- **WIRELESS**: Communication without wires.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Matter or essence.
- **THRUST**: Force or main point.

These words each connect to different meanings of the word "essence" or "central part." 

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can try another combination or start over with a different word. Let me know if you want to explore other possibilities!

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **BIG** - deal, bang, apple, time
- **MEAT** - loaf, market, ball, grinder
- **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, control, matter
- **SUE** - storm, me, happy, Grafton
- **LADY** - bird, luck, gaga, liberty
- **EARLY** - bird, riser, adopter, morning
- **CORE** - strength, apple, values, group
- **DEMI** - Moore, god, tasse, Lovato
- **THRUST** - vector, stage, forward, area
- **WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, router
- **PUSH-UP** - bra, challenge, exercise, position
- **SPORTS** - car, center, team, news

### Observations:

Let's look for a common word or phrase that can follow four of these puzzle words.

1. **BIG** - "bang" (big bang)
2. **MEAT** - "ball" (meatball)
3. **SUBSTANCE** - "abuse" (substance abuse)
4. **SUE** - "storm" (Sue Storm, a character from Fantastic Four)
5. **LADY** - "bird" (Lady Bird)
6. **EARLY** - "bird" (early bird)
7. **CORE** - "strength" (core strength)
8. **DEMI** - "Moore" (Demi Moore)
9. **THRUST** - "vector" (thrust vector)
10. **WIRELESS** - "network" (wireless network)
11. **PUSH-UP** - "bra" (push-up bra)
12. **SPORTS** - "car" (sports car)

### Potential Pattern Matches:

- **LADY** and **EARLY** can both be followed by "bird" (Lady Bird, early bird).
- **BIG** and **MEAT** can both be followed by "ball" (big ball, meatball).

Let's see if we can find a group of four:

1. **LADY** - bird
2. **EARLY** - bird
3. **BIG** - ball
4. **MEAT** - ball

Unfortunately, these don't form a group of four with the same following word or phrase.

Let's try another approach:

1. **BIG** - "bang" (big bang)
2. **MEAT** - "market" (meat market)
3. **SUBSTANCE** - "abuse" (substance abuse)
4. **WIRELESS** - "network" (wireless network)

No clear pattern emerges here either.

### Conclusion:

The strongest potential pattern involves:

- **LADY**
- **EARLY**

Both can be followed by "bird", but we need two more words to complete the set. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a group of four words that can all be followed by the same word or phrase from this list. Let's try another pattern or set of words.

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are parts of the same thing or process.

1. **BIG, DEMI, EARLY, LADY**: These words could be related to different types of roles or titles. For example, "BIG" could refer to a "big shot" or "big boss," "DEMI" could refer to "demigod" or "demigoddess," "EARLY" could refer to an "early bird," and "LADY" is a title. However, this connection seems a bit weak and not quite fitting the pattern of being parts of the same thing or process.

2. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**: These words could be related to physical exercise or fitness. "THRUST" and "PUSH-UP" are types of exercises, "CORE" refers to core muscles which are often targeted in workouts, and "SPORTS" is a general category that includes physical activities. This seems like a stronger connection, as they all relate to fitness and exercise.

3. **SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, WIRELESS**: This combination is less clear. "SUBSTANCE" and "MEAT" could be related to food or nutrition, "CORE" could refer to the core of a fruit or the central part of something, and "WIRELESS" seems unrelated to the others.

4. **SUE, LADY, DEMI, EARLY**: These words could be related to names or titles. "SUE" is a name, "LADY" is a title, "DEMI" could refer to a name or title (like Demi Moore), and "EARLY" doesn't fit well here.

Based on these observations, the strongest connection seems to be:

**THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**: These words are all related to physical exercise or fitness. "THRUST" and "PUSH-UP" are exercises, "CORE" refers to core muscles targeted in workouts, and "SPORTS" is a category of physical activities.

This group seems to fit the pattern of being parts of the same thing or process, specifically related to fitness and exercise. Let me know if you think this is a viable solution or if we should explore other possibilities.

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying potential synonymous verbs among the given puzzle words.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words That Can Be Synonymous Verbs

1. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can be verbs related to the action of pushing or exerting force. "Thrust" means to push something suddenly or violently, while "push-up" can refer to the action of pushing oneself up, especially in the context of exercise.

2. **SUE**: This can be a verb meaning to take legal action against someone.

3. **CORE**: This can be a verb meaning to remove the central part of something, like coring an apple.

### Step 2: See If Other Puzzle Words Can Also Be Synonymous Verbs

Let's explore if other words can fit into these categories:

- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: We need two more words that can mean to push or exert force.
  - **SHOVE**: This could be a potential word if it were in the list, but it's not.
  - **DRIVE**: This could work if it were in the list, but it's not.

- **SUE**: We need three more words that can mean to take legal action or something similar.
  - Unfortunately, none of the other words seem to fit this category.

- **CORE**: We need three more words that can mean to remove the central part of something.
  - Again, none of the other words seem to fit this category.

### Conclusion

It seems like we don't have a complete set of four words that can be synonymous verbs based on the current list. Let's try another approach or pattern if possible. If you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern we should consider, let me know!
