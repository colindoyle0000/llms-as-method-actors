You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully analyze the notes and the list of words to determine if we should submit a guess.

The notes provide three potential solutions, all of which involve the words **THRUST, CORE, MEAT,** and **SUBSTANCE**. These words are said to relate to the concept of "essence" or "central part." Let's evaluate this connection:

1. **THRUST**: Can refer to the main point or driving force.
2. **CORE**: Often used to describe the central or most important part.
3. **MEAT**: Can metaphorically refer to the substance or main part of something.
4. **SUBSTANCE**: Refers to the essential nature or most important part.

These words do seem to fit well together under the concept of "essence" or "central part." Importantly, none of the other words in the list (WIRELESS, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, LADY, EARLY, DEMI, SUE, BIG) fit this connection as well as these four words do.

The notes suggest that this is a strong connection, and it appears to be unique to these four words. There are no indications that this guess has been previously submitted and found incorrect.

Given this analysis, it seems that submitting the guess **THRUST, CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE** is a strong option. It fits the criteria of having a unique and specific connection that applies equally to all four words.

Therefore, I recommend submitting this guess./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
