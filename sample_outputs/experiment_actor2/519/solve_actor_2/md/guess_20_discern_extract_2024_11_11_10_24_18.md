## Prompts

system: ""”

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 The following guesses were incorrect: 
CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS


Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's go through the list of puzzle words and see if we can identify a unique characteristic that connects four of them. We'll consider how the words are structured or how they sound, rather than their meanings.

1. **PUSH-UP**
2. **SUBSTANCE**
3. **THRUST**
4. **MEAT**
5. **CORE**
6. **DEMI**
7. **SPORTS**
8. **WIRELESS**

Let's try saying them aloud and see if any patterns emerge:

- **PUSH-UP**: This is a compound word with a hyphen.
- **SUBSTANCE**: This is a straightforward noun.
- **THRUST**: This is a verb or noun, depending on context.
- **MEAT**: This is a straightforward noun.
- **CORE**: This is a straightforward noun.
- **DEMI**: This is a prefix or a standalone word meaning "half."
- **SPORTS**: This is a straightforward noun.
- **WIRELESS**: This is a compound word without a hyphen.

Let's consider some potential patterns:

1. **Compound Words**: PUSH-UP and WIRELESS are compound words. We need two more to fit this pattern, but none of the others seem to fit.

2. **Words with Silent Letters**: None of these words seem to have silent letters.

3. **Words with Double Letters**: None of these words have double letters.

4. **Words with Prefixes or Suffixes**: DEMI is a prefix, and WIRELESS has a suffix (-less). However, we need two more words to fit this pattern.

5. **Words with a Specific Number of Syllables**: Let's count the syllables:
   - PUSH-UP: 2 syllables
   - SUBSTANCE: 2 syllables
   - THRUST: 1 syllable
   - MEAT: 1 syllable
   - CORE: 1 syllable
   - DEMI: 2 syllables
   - SPORTS: 1 syllable
   - WIRELESS: 2 syllables

   We have four words with 2 syllables: PUSH-UP, SUBSTANCE, DEMI, and WIRELESS. This could be a potential pattern.

Let's propose this as a possible solution: **PUSH-UP, SUBSTANCE, DEMI, WIRELESS** (all have 2 syllables).

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern. Let me know if you want to explore further!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Let's start by examining the list of puzzle words: SPORTS, THRUST, PUSH-UP, MEAT, CORE, SUBSTANCE, WIRELESS, DEMI.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category.

1. **SPORTS and PUSH-UP**: These could both relate to physical activities or exercises.
2. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: These could both relate to something fundamental or essential.
3. **WIRELESS and DEMI**: These don't seem to fit together in an obvious category.

Let's explore the first option further:

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category.

- **SPORTS**: This is a broad category that includes various physical activities.
- **PUSH-UP**: This is a specific exercise, which fits under the category of physical activities or exercises.
- **THRUST**: This could relate to a movement or action, possibly fitting into a category of physical actions or dynamics.
- **CORE**: In fitness, this refers to exercises targeting the core muscles, which could fit into the category of exercises.

So, one possible category could be "types of physical activities or exercises":

1. SPORTS
2. PUSH-UP
3. THRUST
4. CORE

This combination seems to fit the pattern of being within the same category related to physical activities or exercises. Let's consider this as a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can explore other categories or combinations.

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's start by examining the list of puzzle words: CORE, SPORTS, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT, PUSH-UP, DEMI.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing.

1. **CORE and THRUST**: Both could be related to physical exercise or strength training. "Core" exercises target the core muscles, and "thrust" could refer to exercises like hip thrusts.
2. **WIRELESS and SUBSTANCE**: These don't seem to have an obvious connection in terms of doing the same thing.
3. **MEAT and SUBSTANCE**: Both could be related to food or nutrition, as meat is a type of substance.
4. **PUSH-UP and THRUST**: Both are exercises, specifically strength training exercises.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words are also a way to do that same thing.

Let's explore the exercise/strength training angle:

- **CORE**: Refers to exercises targeting the core muscles.
- **THRUST**: Could refer to exercises like hip thrusts.
- **PUSH-UP**: A common bodyweight exercise.
- **SPORTS**: While not an exercise per se, sports often involve physical activity and exercise.

This gives us a potential group: CORE, THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS. However, this was already guessed and found incorrect.

Let's try another angle:

- **CORE**: Could also refer to the central part of something.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Could refer to the essence or core of something.
- **MEAT**: Often used metaphorically to mean the core or main part of something.
- **THRUST**: Could metaphorically mean the main point or core idea.

This gives us another potential group: CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST. These words can all metaphorically refer to the central or main part of something.

Let's submit this group and see if it fits the pattern. If not, we can try another approach.

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives.

1. **SUBSTANCE**: As an adjective, "substantial" could mean something like "significant" or "important."
2. **MEAT**: As an adjective, "meaty" could mean "substantial" or "significant" in terms of content or importance.

These two words can be synonymous adjectives meaning "substantial" or "significant."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.

3. **CORE**: As an adjective, "core" can mean "central" or "essential," which aligns with "substantial" or "significant."
4. **THRUST**: As an adjective, "thrust" doesn't directly fit, but if we consider "thrust" in terms of "main thrust" or "primary focus," it could align with "central" or "significant."

Let's see if we can find a better fit for the fourth word:

- **WIRELESS**: As an adjective, it doesn't fit the pattern of "substantial" or "significant."
- **DEMI**: As an adjective, it means "half" or "partial," which doesn't fit.
- **PUSH-UP**: As an adjective, it doesn't fit the pattern.

Given the options, the best fit for a group of four synonymous adjectives might be:

- **SUBSTANCE** (substantial)
- **MEAT** (meaty)
- **CORE** (central, essential)
- **THRUST** (main thrust, primary focus)

This group aligns with the idea of being "substantial" or "significant." If this doesn't work, we may need to consider a different pattern or set of synonyms. Let me know if you want to explore another angle or if there's another pattern to consider.

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's tackle this step by step. We need to find four words from the list that can be synonymous with each other, functioning as the same part of speech. 

1. **Identify potential synonyms:**

   - **CORE**: This can mean the central or most important part of something. 
   - **THRUST**: As a noun, it can mean the main point or essence of something.
   - **MEAT**: Informally, this can refer to the essential part or substance of something.
   - **SUBSTANCE**: This can mean the essential nature or most important part of something.

2. **Check if they function as the same part of speech:**

   - All four words can function as nouns, referring to the essential or central part of something.

3. **Verify the synonymy:**

   - **CORE**, **THRUST**, **MEAT**, and **SUBSTANCE** can all be used to describe the essential or central part of something, making them synonymous in this context.

Therefore, a possible solution to the puzzle is: **CORE, THRUST, MEAT, SUBSTANCE**. 

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or set of words. Let me know if you need further assistance!
