You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and see if any of them align with the words provided:

1. **Brainstorming Note #1:**
   - **Solution:** PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, THRUST, CORE (Exercises)
   - **Evaluation:** PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, THRUST, and CORE are all present in the list. This is a strong connection as they all relate to exercises.

2. **Brainstorming Note #5:**
   - **Solution:** CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, MEAT (Words followed by "bar")
   - **Evaluation:** CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, and MEAT are all present in the list. This is a strong connection as they can all be followed by "bar."

Both of these guesses are strong and align with the words provided. However, the connection for Brainstorming Note #5 (Words followed by "bar") is particularly specific and unique, which makes it a very strong candidate for submission.

**Decision:**
- **Submit the guess:** CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, MEAT (Words followed by "bar")

This guess has a clear and specific connection, making it a strong choice for submission./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
