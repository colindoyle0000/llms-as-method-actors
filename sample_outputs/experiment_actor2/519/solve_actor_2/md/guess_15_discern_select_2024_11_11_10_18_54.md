You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 The following guesses were incorrect: 
CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS


Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's evaluate the possible guesses from the notes and see which one is the strongest:

1. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST**:
   - **Explanation**: These words are suggested to be synonymous adjectives in the sense of being essential or central. "Core" and "substance" can mean central or essential, "meaty" can mean substantial or significant, and "thrust" can imply a central or main point.
   - **Analysis**: This connection seems plausible as each word can relate to the idea of being central or essential. The words fit well together in this context.

2. **DEMI, SUBSTANCE, WIRELESS, PUSH-UP**:
   - **Explanation**: These words all have two syllables, which is a potential pattern based on syllable count.
   - **Analysis**: While this is a valid observation, the connection based on syllable count is quite generic and not as strong or unique as the first guess. The connection doesn't provide a deeper or more specific relationship between the words.

Given the analysis, the first guess, **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST**, seems to be the strongest viable option. It provides a specific and meaningful connection between the words, which aligns with the guidelines for solving the puzzle.

**Top Choice for Submission**: CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST

Since the notes indicate that the guess "CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS" was incorrect, we should avoid submitting any guess that includes those words together. 

Based on the analysis, the strongest guess to submit is **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST**. This guess has a specific and meaningful connection, making it a strong candidate for submission. 

Let's submit **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST** as the answer for this puzzle./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
