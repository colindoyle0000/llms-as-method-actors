system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and see if any of them align with the words provided:

1. **Brainstorming Note #1:**
   - **Solution:** PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, THRUST, CORE (Exercises)
   - **Evaluation:** PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, THRUST, and CORE are all present in the list. This is a strong connection as they all relate to exercises.

2. **Brainstorming Note #5:**
   - **Solution:** CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, MEAT (Words followed by "bar")
   - **Evaluation:** CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, and MEAT are all present in the list. This is a strong connection as they can all be followed by "bar."

Both of these guesses are strong and align with the words provided. However, the connection for Brainstorming Note #5 (Words followed by "bar") is particularly specific and unique, which makes it a very strong candidate for submission.

**Decision:**
- **Submit the guess:** CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, MEAT (Words followed by "bar")

This guess has a clear and specific connection, making it a strong choice for submission.

"""

user: Yes = submit a guess. No = go back to brainstorming.
