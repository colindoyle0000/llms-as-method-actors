system: ""”

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 

Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding four words that are each a type of the same thing.

1. **Identify two puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing:**

   - **SPORTS** and **CORE**: These don't seem to be types of the same thing.
   - **PUSH-UP** and **THRUST**: Both are types of physical movements or exercises.
   - **MEAT** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can be types of food or material, but not specific enough.
   - **DEMI** and **LADY**: Both can be types of titles or roles, but not specific enough.
   - **EARLY** and **BIG**: Both are adjectives, but not specific types of the same thing.
   - **SUE** and **WIRELESS**: These don't seem to be types of the same thing.

2. **See if other puzzle words are also a type of the same thing:**

   - **PUSH-UP**, **THRUST**, and let's see if there are other words related to physical movements or exercises:
     - **SPORTS**: Could be related as sports involve physical movements.
     - **CORE**: Often associated with core exercises.
     - **BIG**: Not directly related.
     - **EARLY**: Not directly related.
     - **MEAT**: Not directly related.
     - **DEMI**: Not directly related.
     - **LADY**: Not directly related.
     - **SUBSTANCE**: Not directly related.
     - **SUE**: Not directly related.
     - **WIRELESS**: Not directly related.

   - **SPORTS**, **PUSH-UP**, **THRUST**, **CORE**: These could all be related to physical fitness or exercise.

3. **Conclusion:**

   - A possible group of four words that are each a type of the same thing could be **SPORTS**, **PUSH-UP**, **THRUST**, and **CORE**, as they all relate to physical fitness or exercise.

If this doesn't seem to fit the pattern, we can try another approach or pattern. Let me know if you want to explore other possibilities!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Let's go through the steps to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match the pattern: Puzzle words that each come after the same word or phrase.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**EARLY** - bird, morning, riser, adopter

**WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, charging

**PUSH-UP** - exercise, bra, challenge

**DEMI** - Moore, god, lovato, glaze

**SUBSTANCE** - abuse, control, chemical, physical

**SUE** - law, court, file, legal

**MEAT** - red, white, ground, processed

**LADY** - first, young, leading, iron

**CORE** - apple, hard, inner, nuclear

**THRUST** - power, engine, vector, force

**BIG** - bang, deal, apple, brother

**SPORTS** - car, news, center, team

**Step 2: Puzzle words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Let's identify any common words that can precede multiple puzzle words:

- **BIG**: BIG LADY, BIG MEAT, BIG CORE, BIG SPORTS
- **WIRELESS**: WIRELESS CORE, WIRELESS THRUST (less likely)
- **DEMI**: DEMI CORE, DEMI THRUST (less likely)

**Step 3: What other puzzle words could have the same word come before them?**

Let's explore the possibilities:

- **BIG**: BIG LADY, BIG MEAT, BIG CORE, BIG SPORTS

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Words that each come after the word “BIG”: LADY, MEAT, CORE, SPORTS

This seems like a plausible solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern. Let me know if you need further assistance!

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by examining the list of words and trying to identify a unique characteristic related to how the words are structured or sound.

1. **Say the words aloud**: SUE, LADY, SPORTS, DEMI, SUBSTANCE, CORE, PUSH-UP, BIG, THRUST, MEAT, WIRELESS, EARLY.

2. **Look for unique characteristics**: 
   - Consider phonetic patterns, such as rhymes, alliteration, or similar sounds.
   - Consider structural patterns, such as prefixes, suffixes, or word length.

3. **Identify potential patterns**:
   - **Compound Words**: PUSH-UP, WIRELESS (both are compound words, but we need two more).
   - **Words with Silent Letters**: DEMI (silent 'i'), CORE (silent 'e'), but this doesn't seem to fit well with others.
   - **Words with Double Letters**: None of the words have double letters.
   - **Words with a Prefix or Suffix**: SUBSTANCE (prefix 'sub-'), WIRELESS (suffix '-less'), but again, not enough matches.

4. **Re-evaluate and try another angle**:
   - **Words with a Single Syllable**: SUE, BIG, MEAT, CORE (all are single-syllable words).

5. **Check if the single-syllable pattern fits**:
   - SUE, BIG, MEAT, CORE all have one syllable. This could be a potential pattern.

6. **Verify the pattern**:
   - Say each word aloud to confirm they all have one syllable.

Based on this analysis, a possible solution could be the group of words: SUE, BIG, MEAT, CORE, as they all share the characteristic of being single-syllable words. 

If this doesn't fit the intended pattern, we can try another approach or look for a different characteristic. Let me know if you want to explore further or if this solution works!

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential categories and seeing if we can group four words together.

1. **WIRELESS**: This could relate to technology, communication, or something that operates without physical connections.

2. **EARLY**: This could relate to time, beginnings, or something that happens before others.

3. **SUBSTANCE**: This could relate to materials, chemistry, or something with physical presence.

4. **PUSH-UP**: This could relate to exercise, fitness, or something that involves physical movement.

5. **BIG**: This could relate to size, importance, or something that is large.

6. **MEAT**: This could relate to food, protein, or something that is edible.

7. **SUE**: This could relate to legal actions, names, or something involving court cases.

8. **LADY**: This could relate to gender, titles, or something involving women.

9. **THRUST**: This could relate to force, movement, or something involving propulsion.

10. **SPORTS**: This could relate to activities, games, or something involving physical competition.

11. **DEMI**: This could relate to names, partial, or something involving halves.

12. **CORE**: This could relate to central, essential, or something involving the center.

Now, let's try to find a category that fits four of these words:

- **Exercise/Fitness**: PUSH-UP, CORE, THRUST, SPORTS
  - These words can all relate to physical fitness or exercise routines.

- **Names**: DEMI, SUE, LADY, EARLY
  - These words can all be names or parts of names (Demi Moore, Sue, Lady Gaga, Early as a surname).

- **Size/Importance**: BIG, CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT
  - These words can relate to something being significant or substantial.

- **Technology/Communication**: WIRELESS, CORE, EARLY, PUSH-UP
  - These words can relate to technology or communication, though this is a bit of a stretch.

The most promising category seems to be **Exercise/Fitness** with PUSH-UP, CORE, THRUST, and SPORTS. These words all fit well within the context of physical fitness and exercise routines. 

Let's go with that as a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can explore other categories or combinations.
 *** 

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying two words that could be a way to do the same thing. We'll then see if we can expand that to a group of four words.

1. **LADY**: This could refer to a woman or be used in a more specific context, like a title.
2. **EARLY**: This could mean something happening before the expected time.
3. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something, or the act of removing the core from fruit.
4. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.
5. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to a material or matter.
6. **BIG**: This is an adjective describing size.
7. **DEMI**: This could refer to something that is half or partial.
8. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without wires.
9. **THRUST**: This could mean to push or drive with force.
10. **SUE**: This means to bring a legal action against someone.
11. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games.
12. **MEAT**: This refers to animal flesh used as food.

Now, let's look for connections:

- **CORE** and **THRUST**: Both could be related to actions involving force or centrality. However, they don't seem to fit a specific pattern together.
- **PUSH-UP** and **THRUST**: Both involve physical exertion or movement, but they don't form a complete set with other words.
- **SUE**: This is a legal action, but none of the other words seem to fit this context.
- **WIRELESS**: This is related to technology, but again, no other words fit this context.

Let's try another angle:

- **CORE** and **MEAT**: Both could relate to food, but they don't form a complete set.
- **BIG** and **DEMI**: Both relate to size, but they don't form a complete set.

Let's try to find a more specific pattern:

- **PUSH-UP**, **THRUST**, **SPORTS**, **SUE**: These could all be related to actions or activities, but they don't fit a specific pattern.

It seems like we're struggling to find a set of four words that fit a specific pattern. Let's try a different approach:

- **CORE**, **SUBSTANCE**, **MEAT**, **BIG**: These could all relate to something substantial or essential, but they don't form a precise pattern.

If we can't find a set of four words that fit a specific pattern, we might need to consider a different pattern or approach. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if we should try a different set of words.

Your response should consist of each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
