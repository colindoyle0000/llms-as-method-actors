You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and see if any of them fit well with the words provided in the puzzle:

1. **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**: These words are related to exercises or movements. In the list, we have CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, and CORE, so this is a valid group.

2. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT**: These words can mean the essential or main part of something. In the list, we have CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, and MEAT, so this is a valid group.

3. **SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, CRUNCH**: These words can function as nouns referring to the essential or central part of something. In the list, we have SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, and CRUNCH, so this is a valid group.

4. **MEAT, MARS, CRUNCH, PAYDAY**: These words can be followed by "bar". In the list, we have MEAT, MARS, CRUNCH, and PAYDAY, so this is a valid group.

Now, let's determine which guess is the strongest:

- **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**: This is a strong guess because all words are related to exercises or movements, which is a clear and specific connection.

- **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT**: This is a strong guess because all words can mean the essential or main part of something, which is a clear and specific connection.

- **SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, CRUNCH**: This is similar to the previous one, but "CRUNCH" as a critical moment is less directly related to the idea of essence compared to the others.

- **MEAT, MARS, CRUNCH, PAYDAY**: This is a strong guess because all words can be followed by "bar", which is a clear and specific connection.

Given the specificity and clarity of the connections, the strongest guesses are:

1. **MEAT, MARS, CRUNCH, PAYDAY**: All can be followed by "bar".
2. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT**: All can mean the essential or main part of something.

Since the connection of being followed by "bar" is very specific and unambiguous, I recommend submitting **MEAT, MARS, CRUNCH, PAYDAY** as a guess. This connection is clear and fits perfectly with the words provided./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
