## Prompts

system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and determine if any are strong enough to submit:

1. **LADY, DEMI, PUSH-UP, CORE**: The connection here is related to types or parts of bras. However, "Lady" doesn't fit as cleanly as the other words, making this connection weaker.

2. **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI, CORE**: This connection relates to types or features of bras. All four words fit well within this context, making it a strong and cohesive connection.

3. **DOVE, BIG, SUE, CORE**: The connection here is that each word can be changed by one letter to form a verb. This is a clever connection but relies on a more abstract transformation.

Given these evaluations, the second guess, **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI, CORE**, seems to be the strongest. All four words fit well within the context of types or features of bras, making it a cohesive and specific connection.

Therefore, I recommend submitting **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI, CORE** as a guess for the puzzle.

user: Yes = submit a guess. No = go back to brainstorming.
