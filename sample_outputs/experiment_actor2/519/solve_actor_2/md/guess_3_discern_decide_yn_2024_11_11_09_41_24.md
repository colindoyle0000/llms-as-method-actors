system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and see if any of them fit well with the words provided in the puzzle:

1. **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**: These words are related to exercises or movements. In the list, we have CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, and CORE, so this is a valid group.

2. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT**: These words can mean the essential or main part of something. In the list, we have CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, and MEAT, so this is a valid group.

3. **SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, CRUNCH**: These words can function as nouns referring to the essential or central part of something. In the list, we have SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, and CRUNCH, so this is a valid group.

4. **MEAT, MARS, CRUNCH, PAYDAY**: These words can be followed by "bar". In the list, we have MEAT, MARS, CRUNCH, and PAYDAY, so this is a valid group.

Now, let's determine which guess is the strongest:

- **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**: This is a strong guess because all words are related to exercises or movements, which is a clear and specific connection.

- **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT**: This is a strong guess because all words can mean the essential or main part of something, which is a clear and specific connection.

- **SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, CRUNCH**: This is similar to the previous one, but "CRUNCH" as a critical moment is less directly related to the idea of essence compared to the others.

- **MEAT, MARS, CRUNCH, PAYDAY**: This is a strong guess because all words can be followed by "bar", which is a clear and specific connection.

Given the specificity and clarity of the connections, the strongest guesses are:

1. **MEAT, MARS, CRUNCH, PAYDAY**: All can be followed by "bar".
2. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT**: All can mean the essential or main part of something.

Since the connection of being followed by "bar" is very specific and unambiguous, I recommend submitting **MEAT, MARS, CRUNCH, PAYDAY** as a guess. This connection is clear and fits perfectly with the words provided.
