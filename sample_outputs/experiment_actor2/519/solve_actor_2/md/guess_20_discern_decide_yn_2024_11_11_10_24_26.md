## Prompts

system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Based on the analysis of the notes, the strongest guess to submit is the group of words that share a specific and unique connection: **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST**. These words can all metaphorically refer to the central or main part of something, making them synonymous in this context. This connection is more specific and unique compared to the other options provided.

The other guesses, such as the one involving words with 2 syllables, are too generic and not specific enough to be a strong guess. Additionally, the guess involving **CORE, DEMI, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** was already noted as incorrect, so it should not be submitted.

Therefore, you should submit the guess **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST** as it is the strongest option from the notes provided.
