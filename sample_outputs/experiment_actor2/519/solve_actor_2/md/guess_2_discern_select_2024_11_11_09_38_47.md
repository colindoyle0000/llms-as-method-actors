You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's analyze the notes and the words provided to determine if there is a strong guess to submit.

1. **SPORTS, CRUNCH, CORE, PUSH-UP**: This connection was considered but noted that "sports" is more general compared to the other words, which are specific exercises. This makes it a weaker connection.

2. **PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE, CRUNCH**: This connection relates to candy brands, which is a strong pop culture reference. All four words are directly related to candy brands, making it a cohesive group.

3. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, BIG**: This connection was considered within the "fitness/exercise" category, but "big" doesn't fit as neatly as the others, which are specific exercises. This makes it a weaker connection.

4. **PAYDAY, DOVE, MARS, CRUNCH**: This connection can modify "bar" to form candy bar names. This is a very strong connection because each word can directly precede "bar" to form a well-known candy bar name.

Given these analyses, the strongest guess from the notes is **PAYDAY, DOVE, MARS, CRUNCH** with the connection being "words that can modify 'bar' to form candy bar names." This connection is precise, specific, and applies equally well to all four words.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess: **PAYDAY, DOVE, MARS, CRUNCH** with the connection being "words that can modify 'bar' to form candy bar names."/n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
