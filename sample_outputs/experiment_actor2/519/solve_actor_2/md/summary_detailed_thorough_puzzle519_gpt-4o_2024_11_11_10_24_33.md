## Evaluations

### Evaluation 1

Let's analyze each of the guesses provided in the notes and evaluate their strength based on the criteria given:

1. **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: 
   - Connection: These are all names of candy brands and can precede "bar" to form candy bar names.
   - Strength: This is a strong connection because it is specific and unique to these words. Each word fits the connection equally well, and they all have the same relationship to the connection.

2. **CRUNCH LADY PAYDAY SPORTS**:
   - Connection: These words can follow "BIG" to form common phrases.
   - Strength: This connection is weaker because "big lady" is not as common or specific as the other phrases. The connection is not as unique or specific as the candy bar connection.

3. **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**:
   - Connection: These words relate to types or features of bras.
   - Strength: This is a strong connection because it is specific and applies equally to each word. Each word represents a style or characteristic associated with bras.

4. **CRUNCH MARS MEAT PAYDAY**:
   - Connection: These words can be followed by "bar."
   - Strength: This is similar to the first guess but includes "MEAT," which is less commonly associated with a "bar" in the same context as the others. This weakens the connection slightly compared to the first guess.

Now, let's select the top two choices that do not overlap:

- **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY** (Candy bars)
- **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS** (Bra types/features)

These two guesses do not overlap in terms of words, making them strong candidates.

Finally, let's determine which of these two is the strongest:

- **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: This connection is very strong due to its specificity and the well-known nature of these candy bars.
- **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: This is also a strong connection, but it might be slightly less universally recognized than the candy bar connection.

Given the criteria and the need for a unique and specific connection, my top choice for submission is **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**. This guess has a clear, specific, and widely recognized connection.

### Evaluation 2

Let's analyze each of the provided guesses based on the criteria for strong guesses:

1. **CRUNCH MARS MEAT PAYDAY**: 
   - Connection: Each word can be followed by "bar" to form a common term (e.g., Crunch bar, Mars bar, Meat bar, Payday bar).
   - Strength: This is a strong connection because it applies equally to all four words and is specific to this group. However, "Meat bar" is less common than the others, which might weaken the guess slightly.

2. **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: All relate to types or features of bras.
   - Strength: This is a strong connection as it applies equally to all four words and is specific. However, "Sports" as a type of bra is more general compared to the others, which are more specific styles.

3. **CRUNCH LADY PAYDAY SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: Each word can follow "BIG" to form common phrases (e.g., big crunch, big lady, big payday, big sports).
   - Strength: This connection is weaker because "big lady" is not a common phrase, and the connection is less specific.

4. **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: 
   - Connection: All are names of candy bars.
   - Strength: This is a very strong connection as it applies equally and specifically to all four words. Each word is a well-known candy bar.

Now, let's select the top two choices that do not overlap:

- **CRUNCH MARS MEAT PAYDAY**: This is a strong choice, but "Meat bar" is less common.
- **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: This is a strong choice, but "Sports" is more general.
- **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: This is the strongest choice as all are well-known candy bars.

The two top choices without overlap are:
1. **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**
2. **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**

Between these two, the strongest choice is **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY** because the connection is very specific and applies equally to all four words as candy bars.

Therefore, my top choice for a guess to submit is **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**.

### Evaluation 3

Let's analyze each of the guesses provided in the notes and evaluate their strengths based on the criteria given:

1. **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: Types or features of bras.
   - Evaluation: This connection is quite specific and fits each word well. "Core," "Demi," "Push-up," and "Sports" are all terms used in the context of bras. This guess seems strong as the connection is unique and specific to this group.

2. **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: 
   - Connection: Types of candy bars.
   - Evaluation: This is a strong connection as well. Each word is a well-known candy bar, and the connection is specific and unique to this group. 

3. **CRUNCH MARS MEAT PAYDAY**: 
   - Connection: Can be followed by "bar."
   - Evaluation: While "Mars bar," "Crunch bar," and "Payday bar" are common, "Meat bar" is less common and might not fit as well. This connection is weaker due to the less common usage of "Meat bar."

4. **CRUNCH LADY PAYDAY SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: Can follow "BIG."
   - Evaluation: "Big crunch," "big payday," and "big sports" are common phrases, but "big lady" is less common and might not fit as well. This connection is weaker due to the less common usage of "big lady."

Now, let's select the two top choices that do not overlap:

- **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: This is a strong guess with a specific and unique connection.
- **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: This is another strong guess with a specific and unique connection.

These two guesses do not overlap in terms of words, which is a good sign.

Finally, let's determine which of these two is the strongest:

- Both guesses are strong, but "CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY" might be slightly stronger because the connection to candy bars is very clear and well-known.

Therefore, my top choice for a guess to submit is **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**.

### Evaluation 4

Let's analyze each of the provided guesses based on the criteria for strong guesses:

1. **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**: 
   - Connection: These words can modify "BIRD" (e.g., Big bird, Early bird, Ladybird, Sue Bird).
   - Strength: This connection is clever and specific, involving both common phrases and a pop culture reference (Sue Bird, the basketball player). Each word fits the connection equally well.

2. **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: These words relate to types or features of bras.
   - Strength: This is a strong connection as each word is a specific style or characteristic of bras. The connection is unique and fits all words equally.

3. **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**: 
   - Connection: These words relate to the concept of "essence" or "central part."
   - Strength: While the connection is valid, it is more abstract and might not be as specific or unique as the others. "Thrust" might be a bit of a stretch compared to the others.

4. **CORE LADY MEAT SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: These words can be preceded by "BIG" to form common phrases.
   - Strength: This connection is specific and unique, but "BIG LADY" might not be as common or specific as the others.

Now, let's select the top two choices that do not overlap:

- **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**: This is a strong choice due to its clever and specific connection.
- **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: This is another strong choice with a clear and specific connection.

These two guesses do not overlap in any words, making them suitable top choices.

Finally, let's determine which of these two is the strongest:

- **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**: This guess is strong due to its cleverness and the pop culture reference, which adds a layer of specificity.
- **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS**: This guess is strong due to its clear and specific connection to a particular category (bras).

Given the criteria and the need for a unique and specific connection, I would choose **CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS** as the top choice to submit. This connection is clear, specific, and fits all words equally well.

### Evaluation 5

Let's analyze each of the guesses provided in the notes and evaluate their strengths based on the criteria given:

1. **CORE LADY MEAT SPORTS**: 
   - Connection: Each word can be preceded by "BIG" to form common phrases.
   - Strengths: The connection is specific and unique, as "BIG" is a fitting prefix for each word.
   - Weaknesses: None apparent; all words fit the connection equally well.

2. **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**: 
   - Connection: Represents the essence or main part of something.
   - Strengths: The connection is thematic and applies to each word.
   - Weaknesses: "THRUST" might be a bit of a stretch compared to the others, as it can be interpreted differently.

3. **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**: 
   - Connection: Can modify the word "BIRD" to form phrases.
   - Strengths: The connection is specific and includes a pop culture reference.
   - Weaknesses: "SUE" as in "Sue Bird" is more of a proper noun, which might not fit as uniformly as the others.

4. **CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS**: 
   - Connection: Theme of "essence" or "central part."
   - Strengths: The connection is thematic.
   - Weaknesses: "WIRELESS" doesn't fit as neatly into the theme of "essence" or "central part" as the others.

Now, let's select the two top choices that do not overlap in words:

- **CORE LADY MEAT SPORTS**: This guess is strong because the connection is clear and specific, with no apparent weaknesses.
- **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**: This guess is also strong, but "SUE" might be a weaker fit due to its reliance on a proper noun.

Since "LADY" overlaps in both guesses, we need to choose one of them. Given the criteria, the strongest guess appears to be:

**CORE LADY MEAT SPORTS**

This guess has a clear and specific connection with no apparent weaknesses, making it the top choice to submit.

### Evaluation 6

Let's analyze each of the provided guesses based on the criteria for strong guesses:

1. **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**:
   - Connection: "Essence" or "central part."
   - Strengths: Each word can metaphorically refer to the main point or essential nature of something.
   - Weaknesses: The connection might be a bit abstract, and "MEAT" might not fit as well as the others in terms of metaphorical usage.

2. **CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS**:
   - Connection: "Essence" or "central part."
   - Strengths: CORE and SUBSTANCE fit well; THRUST can be seen as the main point or force.
   - Weaknesses: WIRELESS seems like a stretch in this context, as it doesn't directly relate to "central part" in the same way.

3. **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**:
   - Connection: Modifiers for "BIRD."
   - Strengths: Each word can modify "BIRD" to form a common phrase or name (e.g., "Big bird," "Early bird," "Ladybird," "Sue Bird").
   - Weaknesses: This connection is strong and specific, with no apparent weaknesses.

4. **CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**:
   - Connection: Physical activities and exercises.
   - Strengths: "Push-up" and "Thrust" are specific exercises, "Core" relates to exercises targeting core muscles, and "Sports" encompasses physical activities.

Based on the analysis, the strongest guess appears to be **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**. This guess has a clear and specific connection, with each word fitting the theme of modifying "BIRD" equally well. Additionally, it doesn't overlap with any other guesses, which is a requirement for selecting the top choice.

Therefore, my top choice for a guess to submit is **BIG EARLY LADY SUE**.

### Evaluation 7

Let's evaluate each of the guesses based on the criteria provided:

1. **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**
   - **Connection**: Essence or main part of something.
   - **Analysis**: 
     - "Core" and "Substance" fit well as they both directly relate to the essence or main part.
     - "Meat" can metaphorically mean the main part of something, but it's less direct.
     - "Thrust" can mean the main point or force, but it's a bit of a stretch.
   - **Conclusion**: This connection is somewhat strong but not perfect, as "Meat" and "Thrust" are less direct fits.

2. **CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**
   - **Connection**: Physical activities and exercises.
   - **Analysis**: 
     - "Core" relates to exercises targeting core muscles.
     - "Push-up" and "Thrust" are specific exercises.
     - "Sports" is a broad category of physical activities.
   - **Conclusion**: This connection is strong, as all words relate to physical activities, but "Core" and "Thrust" are less specific compared to "Push-up" and "Sports."

3. **CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS**
   - **Connection**: Essence or central part.
   - **Analysis**: 
     - "Core" and "Substance" fit well with the theme of essence or central part.
     - "Thrust" can be seen as the main point or force, but it's a bit of a stretch.
     - "Wireless" is a weak fit, as it doesn't directly relate to essence or centrality.
   - **Conclusion**: This connection is weak due to the inclusion of "Wireless," which doesn't fit well.

Based on the analysis, the strongest guess is **CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**. This group has a clear connection to physical activities and exercises, and each word fits the theme reasonably well. While "Core" and "Thrust" are less specific, they still relate to the theme of physical activities, making this the best choice among the options provided.

**Top Choice for Submission**: CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST

### Evaluation 8

Let's analyze the possible guesses and evaluate their strengths based on the criteria provided:

1. **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**
   - **Connection**: Essence or main part of something.
   - **Evaluation**:
     - **CORE**: Fits well as it represents the central part.
     - **MEAT**: Can be seen as the main part of a meal or the essence of a discussion.
     - **SUBSTANCE**: Represents the essential part of a matter.
     - **THRUST**: Can be interpreted as the main point or force.
   - **Strengths**: The connection is unique and specific, and each word fits the theme of "essence" or "main part" equally well.

2. **CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS**
   - **Connection**: Essence or central part.
   - **Evaluation**:
     - **CORE**: Fits well as it represents the central part.
     - **SUBSTANCE**: Represents the essential part of a matter.
     - **THRUST**: Can be interpreted as the main point or force.
     - **WIRELESS**: This is a weaker fit. While it suggests communication without wires, it doesn't directly relate to the theme of "essence" or "central part" in the same way as the other words.
   - **Weaknesses**: The connection is less specific for WIRELESS, making this guess weaker.

Considering the criteria for strong guesses, the first guess, **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**, is the strongest. It has a unique and specific connection that applies equally well to all four words, with each word having the same relationship to the connection.

Therefore, my top choice for a guess to submit is **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**.

### Evaluation 9

Let's analyze the given words and the potential connections:

1. **CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**: The rationale provided is that these words all metaphorically refer to the central or main part of something. This connection seems strong because:
   - Each word can indeed represent the essence or primary component of something.
   - The connection is not overly simple and requires some thought to see the metaphorical link.
   - The words fit the connection equally well and with the same level of specificity.
   - Each word has the same relationship to the connection, functioning as nouns that describe a central or main part.

2. **SPORTS, WIRELESS, DEMI, PUSH-UP**: Let's consider potential connections for these words:
   - **SPORTS**: Could relate to activities, games, or physical exertion.
   - **WIRELESS**: Could relate to technology, communication, or lack of physical connection.
   - **DEMI**: Often used as a prefix meaning "half" or "partial."
   - **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise or physical activity.

   It's challenging to find a unique and specific connection that ties these four words together in the same way as the first group. They don't seem to share a metaphorical or thematic link that is as strong or specific as the first group.

Given the analysis, the strongest guess to submit is:

**CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**

This group has a clear, metaphorical connection that fits all the criteria for a strong guess in a New York Times connections puzzle.

Reasoning:
The words THRUST, CORE, MEAT, and SUBSTANCE are connected by the concept of "essence" or "central part." Each word can metaphorically refer to the main point, central part, or essential nature of something.

### Guess 9

Rejected because no good options for guess: Let's carefully evaluate the potential connections for the words provided and determine if any of the guesses are strong enough to submit.

1. **DEMI**, **LADY**, **BIG**, **EARLY**: The suggested connection is that these words can function as adjectives or descriptors that modify nouns. While this is true, the connection is quite generic and not unique enough to be a strong guess. Many words can serve as adjectives or modifiers, so this connection lacks the specificity typically required for a New York Times connections puzzle.

Let's explore other possible connections among the remaining words:

- **SUBSTANCE**, **MEAT**, **CORE**, **THRUST**: These words could potentially relate to the idea of "essence" or "central part." However, "THRUST" might not fit as cleanly into this category as the others.

- **THRUST**, **PUSH-UP**, **SPORTS**, **WIRELESS**: These words could relate to physical activities or exercises, but "WIRELESS" doesn't fit this category.

- **SUE**, **SPORTS**, **WIRELESS**, **PUSH-UP**: These words don't seem to form a coherent or specific connection.

- **DEMI**, **LADY**, **BIG**, **EARLY**: As previously discussed, this connection is too generic.

Given the analysis, none of the connections seem strong or specific enough to submit confidently. The connection involving adjectives or descriptors is too broad, and the other potential connections don't fit all four words cleanly.

**Decision:**
We should go back to brainstorming other possible connections. The current guesses lack the specificity and uniqueness required for a strong submission. Let's explore other potential connections or combinations of words that might reveal a more precise and unique relationship.

### Guess 10

Guess: CORE LADY MEAT SPORTS

Reasoning:
The words LADY, MEAT, CORE, and SPORTS are connected by the fact that each can be preceded by the word "BIG" to form common phrases (e.g., BIG LADY, BIG MEAT, BIG CORE, BIG SPORTS). This connection is specific and unique, highlighting a pattern where "BIG" is a fitting prefix for each word.

### Guess 11

Submitted and Correct: Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words "CORE," "MEAT," "SUBSTANCE," and "THRUST" are connected by the theme of representing the essence or main part of something. Each word signifies a central or fundamental component, highlighting their shared connection.

### Guess 12

Submitted and Correct: Guess: BIG EARLY LADY SUE

Reasoning:
The words "BIG," "EARLY," "LADY," and "SUE" are all connected because they can modify the word "BIRD," forming phrases like "Big bird," "Early bird," "Ladybird," and "Sue Bird." This connection involves both common phrases and a pop culture reference.

### Guess 13

Guess: CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS

Reasoning:
The words CORE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, and THRUST are connected through the theme of "essence" or "central part." CORE and SUBSTANCE directly relate to this theme, while THRUST can be seen as the main point or force, and WIRELESS suggests communication without the "core" of wires, tying into the idea of centrality.

### Guess 14

Guess: CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST

Reasoning:
The words "CORE," "PUSH-UP," "SPORTS," and "THRUST" are connected through their association with physical activities and exercises. "Push-up" and "Thrust" are specific exercises, "Core" relates to exercises targeting core muscles, and "Sports" encompasses a broad category of physical activities.

### Guess 15

Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words "CORE," "SUBSTANCE," "MEAT," and "THRUST" are connected by the concept of being essential or central. Each word can imply something that is fundamental or significant, such as "core" and "substance" meaning central, "meaty" meaning substantial, and "thrust" implying a main point.

### Guess 16

Rejected because no good options for guess: Let's analyze the words again and see if we can find a strong connection among them. We need to find a group of four words that share a unique and specific connection.

1. **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise.
2. **DEMI**: Could refer to "demi" meaning half or partial, or it could be a name.
3. **WIRELESS**: Refers to technology that operates without wires, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
4. **SUBSTANCE**: A general term that can refer to a material or matter.
5. **CORE**: Can refer to the central part of something, or in fitness, it refers to the muscles of the torso.
6. **MEAT**: A type of food, specifically animal flesh.
7. **SPORTS**: Refers to physical activities or games.
8. **THRUST**: Can refer to a forceful push or movement.

Let's try to find a connection:

- **PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS, THRUST**: These words could relate to physical fitness or exercise. However, this guess was already identified as incorrect in the notes.

- **DEMI, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, MEAT**: It's challenging to find a specific connection among these words. They don't seem to fit into a clear category or share a unique characteristic.

- **CORE, THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS**: This was the initial guess, but it was incorrect.

Given the constraints and the words provided, it seems we don't have a strong alternative guess that fits the criteria. The notes only provided one potential solution, which was already incorrect. Without additional context or words, it's difficult to form a new viable guess.

Since the notes didn't provide any other viable solutions and the initial guess was incorrect, we might need to reconsider the words or look for a different angle. However, based on the information provided, we don't have enough to form a new, strong guess.

Based on the analysis, I recommend going back to brainstorming other possible connections. We don't have a strong guess to submit at this time. Let's look for additional clues or reconsider the context to find a viable solution.

### Guess 17

Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE, and THRUST are connected by the idea of being the main part or essence of something. Each word represents a kind of "essence" or "central part."

### Guess 18

Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words "CORE," "MEAT," "SUBSTANCE," and "THRUST" are connected by the concept of the "main part" or "essence" of something. Each word represents an essential or central component within its respective context.

### Guess 19

Rejected because no good options for guess: Let's carefully analyze the notes and the words provided to determine if there's a strong guess to submit.

From the notes, we have the following possible guesses:

1. **WIRELESS, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, CORE**: This group was considered but "wireless" felt out of place compared to the others, which are more directly related to physical exercises.

2. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, PUSH-UP**: This group was identified as having a strong connection related to physical fitness or exercise, as all words can be related to physical exertion or fitness activities.

3. **WIRELESS, SPORTS, THRUST, PUSH-UP**: This group was considered but "wireless" again felt slightly out of place compared to the others.

The notes indicate that the guess **CORE, DEMI, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** was incorrect. Therefore, we should not submit this guess.

Given the analysis, the group **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, PUSH-UP** was identified as having the strongest connection related to physical fitness or exercise. However, since the notes indicate that **CORE, DEMI, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** was incorrect, and considering the potential overlap in themes, it's possible that the connection we identified might not be correct either.

Since the notes suggest that the guess **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, PUSH-UP** was not explicitly marked as incorrect, and it was identified as the strongest connection, it might still be worth considering. However, given the uncertainty and the fact that a similar guess was incorrect, it might be prudent to go back to brainstorming other possible connections.

In conclusion, I recommend going back to brainstorming other possible connections, as the current options do not provide a sufficiently strong guess to submit with confidence.

### Guess 20

Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE, and THRUST all metaphorically refer to the central or main part of something. They are synonymous in the context of representing the essence or primary component of an object or concept.
