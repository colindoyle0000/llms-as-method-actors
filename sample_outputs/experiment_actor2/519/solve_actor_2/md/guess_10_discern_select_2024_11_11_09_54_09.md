You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully evaluate the notes and the list of words to determine if we have a strong guess to submit.

1. **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**: This connection relates to physical fitness or exercise. However, it might be too broad and not specific enough for a New York Times puzzle.

2. **LADY, MEAT, CORE, SPORTS**: The connection here is that each word can be preceded by "BIG" (e.g., BIG LADY, BIG MEAT, BIG CORE, BIG SPORTS). This is a specific and unique connection, making it a strong candidate.

3. **SUE, BIG, MEAT, CORE**: The connection is that they are single-syllable words. This is too generic and unlikely to be correct.

4. **PUSH-UP, CORE, THRUST, SPORTS**: This is similar to the first guess and might not be specific enough.

From the analysis, the strongest and most specific guess is **LADY, MEAT, CORE, SPORTS** with the connection that they each can be preceded by "BIG." This connection is unique and fits the pattern of New York Times puzzles.

Given the options, I recommend submitting **LADY, MEAT, CORE, SPORTS** as the guess, as it is the most specific and likely to be correct based on the notes provided./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
