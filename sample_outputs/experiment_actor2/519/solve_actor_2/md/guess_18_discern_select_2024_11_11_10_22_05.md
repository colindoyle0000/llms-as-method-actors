You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 The following guesses were incorrect: 
CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS


Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and the list of words provided:

1. **MEAT, CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**: 
   - This group has a strong connection as they all relate to the concept of the "main part" or "essence" of something. Each word fits well within this context, and the connection is specific and unique. This is a strong candidate for submission.

2. **CORE, PUSH-UP, THRUST, WIRELESS**: 
   - While core exercises, push-ups, and thrusts are related to fitness, the inclusion of "WIRELESS" seems a bit off. Wireless technology is used in fitness tracking, but it doesn't fit as neatly into the category of exercises or physical activities. This connection feels less specific and more forced.

Given the analysis, the strongest viable guess is:

- **MEAT, CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST** - These words all connect to the concept of "ESSENCE" or "MAIN PART." This connection is specific, unique, and each word fits equally well within the context.

Since the other guess involving "WIRELESS" and "PUSH-UP" seems less coherent and forced, and considering that the guess "CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS" was already incorrect, the best course of action is to submit the guess **MEAT, CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**.

Let's submit this guess as it appears to be the strongest and most coherent option from the notes./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
