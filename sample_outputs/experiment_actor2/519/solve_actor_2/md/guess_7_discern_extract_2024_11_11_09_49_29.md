## Prompts

system: ""”

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 

Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential pop culture references among the puzzle words.

1. **CORE**: This could refer to "Apple Core," a play on the tech company Apple, or perhaps the "core" of a team or group in sports or entertainment.

2. **SUE**: This could refer to "Sue Storm," a character from the Fantastic Four, or "Sue Sylvester," a character from the TV show "Glee."

3. **THRUST**: This might relate to a concept in science fiction or action movies, such as "thrust" in space travel.

4. **DOVE**: This could refer to the soap brand, or perhaps the song "When Doves Cry" by Prince.

5. **DEMI**: This could refer to Demi Lovato or Demi Moore, both well-known figures in pop culture.

6. **SUBSTANCE**: This might relate to the phrase "substance over style," or perhaps a song or album title.

7. **MEAT**: This could refer to "Meat Loaf," the musician, or perhaps a reference to "meat" in a culinary or cultural context.

8. **PUSH-UP**: This might relate to fitness culture or a specific brand or product.

9. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to wireless technology, or perhaps a song or album title.

10. **PAYDAY**: This could refer to the candy bar, or perhaps a movie or song title.

11. **MARS**: This could refer to Bruno Mars, the musician, or the planet Mars, which is often referenced in science fiction.

12. **LADY**: This could refer to "Lady Gaga," or perhaps "Lady and the Tramp," the Disney movie.

13. **EARLY**: This might relate to a phrase or concept, such as "early bird," or a song or album title.

14. **BIG**: This could refer to the movie "Big" starring Tom Hanks, or perhaps "Notorious B.I.G.," the rapper.

15. **SPORTS**: This could refer to the general category of sports, or perhaps a specific sports team or event.

16. **CRUNCH**: This could refer to the candy bar, or perhaps a fitness brand or concept.

Now, let's try to find a group of four words that share a pop culture reference:

- **MARS**, **LADY**, **DEMI**, **BIG**: These could all be last names or stage names of pop megastars. Mars (Bruno Mars), Lady (Lady Gaga), Demi (Demi Lovato), Big (Notorious B.I.G.).

This seems like a plausible group that fits the pattern of pop culture references. If this doesn't work, we can explore other combinations or patterns. Let me know if you want to try another approach!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding words that can mean the same thing and function as the same part of speech.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words That Can Mean the Same Thing

1. **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can be nouns meaning the essential part or essence of something.
2. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can be verbs meaning to push or drive forward with force.
3. **BIG** and **LADY**: This is a bit of a stretch, but if we consider "big" as an adjective meaning important or significant, and "lady" as a noun meaning a woman of importance, there might be a connection, though it's not strong.
4. **CRUNCH** and **THRUST**: Both can be verbs meaning to apply force or pressure, though in different contexts.

### Step 2: See If Other Puzzle Words Can Also Mean the Same Thing

Let's explore the first pair, **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**, and see if other words fit:

- **CORE**: Essential part, essence.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Essential part, essence.

Looking at the list, none of the other words seem to fit this specific meaning.

Let's try the second pair, **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**:

- **THRUST**: To push or drive forward with force.
- **PUSH-UP**: To push upward, though typically a noun for an exercise, it can imply a forceful upward motion.

Other words that might fit:
- **CRUNCH**: To apply force or pressure, often in a decisive or forceful manner.
- **WIRELESS**: This doesn't fit the pattern.

Let's try another pair, **CRUNCH** and **THRUST**:

- **CRUNCH**: To apply force or pressure.
- **THRUST**: To push or drive forward with force.

Other words that might fit:
- **PUSH-UP**: As discussed, can imply a forceful motion.
- **SUE**: This doesn't fit the pattern.

### Conclusion

The strongest connection seems to be between **THRUST**, **PUSH-UP**, and **CRUNCH** as verbs related to applying force or pressure. However, we need a fourth word to complete the set, and none of the remaining words fit this pattern precisely.

If we can't find a fourth word, we might need to consider a different pattern or request additional puzzle words to work with. Let me know if you want to explore another pattern or need further assistance.

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We need to identify a category where each puzzle word can be part of a different word within that category. Let's start by examining the list of words:

1. CRUNCH
2. SUE
3. PUSH-UP
4. BIG
5. DOVE
6. PAYDAY
7. THRUST
8. DEMI
9. MEAT
10. WIRELESS
11. MARS
12. LADY
13. CORE
14. SPORTS
15. EARLY
16. SUBSTANCE

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

Let's start by identifying two words that can be part of a different word within the same category. 

- **MARS**: This could be part of the category "Planets" (e.g., Mars is a planet).
- **EARLY**: This could be part of the category "Times of Day" (e.g., early morning).

These two don't match a category yet, so let's keep looking.

### Step 2: Explore Other Words

Let's try another approach by looking for more specific categories:

- **CRUNCH**: Could be part of "Exercise Moves" (e.g., crunches).
- **PUSH-UP**: Also fits "Exercise Moves" (e.g., push-ups).

This seems promising. Let's see if we can find more words in this category:

- **THRUST**: Could be part of "Exercise Moves" (e.g., hip thrusts).
- **CORE**: Could be part of "Exercise Moves" (e.g., core exercises).

### Step 3: Verify the Category

We have identified four words that fit the category "Exercise Moves":
1. CRUNCH
2. PUSH-UP
3. THRUST
4. CORE

These words can all be part of different exercise moves, which fits the pattern of being parts of different words within the same category.

### Conclusion

The group of four words that match the pattern is:
- CRUNCH
- PUSH-UP
- THRUST
- CORE

This solution fits the pattern of being parts of different words within the category "Exercise Moves." Let me know if you need further assistance or if we should explore another pattern.

Now, let's identify a common word that can be modified by four of these puzzle words. 

- **Candy**: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE

These four words can all modify "candy," as they are all types of candy bars. 

Therefore, the solution to the puzzle is: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE. 

Let me know if you need further assistance or if you want to try another pattern!

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are each a kind of the same thing. 

1. **CRUNCH**: This could refer to a type of exercise (abdominal crunch), a type of sound, or even a type of candy bar (Nestlé Crunch).

2. **PAYDAY**: This is a type of candy bar.

3. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something, a type of exercise (core workout), or even a type of apple core.

4. **MEAT**: This is a general term for food, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

5. **MARS**: This could refer to the planet, but more relevantly, it's a type of candy bar (Mars bar).

6. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a general term and doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

7. **THRUST**: This could refer to a type of force or movement, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

8. **EARLY**: This is a descriptor of time and doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

9. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to technology, such as wireless internet or wireless devices.

10. **DOVE**: This could refer to a type of bird or a brand of chocolate (Dove chocolate).

11. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.

12. **SUE**: This could refer to a legal action, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

13. **LADY**: This could refer to a type of person or a title, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

14. **DEMI**: This could refer to a prefix meaning "half" or a name, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

15. **BIG**: This is a descriptor of size and doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

16. **SPORTS**: This is a general term for physical activities, but it doesn't immediately suggest a specific type of something.

Now, let's see if we can find a group of four words that are each a kind of the same thing:

- **Candy Bars**: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE

These four words all refer to types of candy bars. This seems to be a strong connection, as they all fit the pattern of being a kind of candy bar.

If this solution doesn't work, we can try to find another pattern, but this seems like a plausible group of four words that match the pattern.
