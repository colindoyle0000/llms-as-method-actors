system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential guesses and the list of words provided to determine if there's a strong guess to submit.

### Analysis of Potential Guesses:

1. **WIRELESS, THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE**:
   - "Wireless" seems out of place compared to the others, which are more directly related to physical exercises.

2. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**:
   - "Thrust" and "Push-up" are specific exercises.
   - "Sports" is a broader category that encompasses physical activities.
   - "Core" relates to exercises targeting the core muscles.

### Evaluation of the Words Provided:

- **CORE**: Can relate to exercises or the central part of something.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Could relate to material or essence.
- **DEMI**: Often used as a prefix meaning "half" or "partial."
- **WIRELESS**: Relates to technology or communication without wires.
- **MEAT**: Refers to animal flesh used as food.
- **EARLY**: Relates to time, meaning before the usual or expected time.
- **SPORTS**: Relates to physical activities or games.
- **THRUST**: Can be a movement or forceful push, often used in exercises.
- **LADY**: Refers to a woman.
- **PUSH-UP**: A specific exercise.
- **SUE**: Can mean to take legal action.
- **BIG**: Refers to size, meaning large.

### Conclusion:

The second guess (**THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**) seems to be the strongest viable guess because all four words are more directly related to physical activities or exercises, and they fit well together in terms of specificity and context. The connection is clear and specific, which aligns with the guidelines for a strong guess.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess: **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**. This guess seems to have the strongest connection among the words provided. If this guess is incorrect, we can then go back to brainstorming other possible connections.
