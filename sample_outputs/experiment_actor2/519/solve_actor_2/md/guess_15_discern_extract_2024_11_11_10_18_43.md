## Prompts

system: ""”

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 The following guesses were incorrect: 
CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS


Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's go through the steps to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match the pattern: puzzle words that each come after the same word or phrase.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**THRUST** - rocket, power, engine, main

**PUSH-UP** - exercise, bra, challenge

**DEMI** - semi, half, moore, lovato

**SUBSTANCE** - controlled, chemical, abuse, physical

**CORE** - apple, nuclear, hard, inner

**MEAT** - red, white, ground, processed

**SPORTS** - team, extreme, water, motor

**WIRELESS** - bluetooth, radio, network, internet

**Step 2: Puzzle words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Let's identify any common words or phrases that could precede multiple puzzle words:

- **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can follow "nuclear" (nuclear core, nuclear substance).
- **SPORTS** and **WIRELESS**: Both can follow "network" (sports network, wireless network).
- **THRUST** and **CORE**: Both can follow "engine" (thrust engine, core engine).

**Step 3: What other puzzle words could have the same word come before them?**

Let's explore these possibilities further:

- **Nuclear**: CORE, SUBSTANCE
  - Nuclear THRUST? Unlikely
  - Nuclear PUSH-UP? No
  - Nuclear DEMI? No
  - Nuclear MEAT? No
  - Nuclear SPORTS? No
  - Nuclear WIRELESS? No

- **Network**: SPORTS, WIRELESS
  - Network THRUST? No
  - Network PUSH-UP? No
  - Network DEMI? No
  - Network CORE? No
  - Network MEAT? No
  - Network SUBSTANCE? No

- **Engine**: THRUST, CORE
  - Engine PUSH-UP? No
  - Engine DEMI? No
  - Engine SUBSTANCE? No
  - Engine MEAT? No
  - Engine SPORTS? No
  - Engine WIRELESS? No

**Step 4: Conclusion**

It seems challenging to find a group of four words that can each have the same word come before them from this list. We might need to consider other potential words or phrases that could precede these puzzle words or try a different pattern. If you have any other ideas or if we should try another pattern, let me know!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Let's go through the list of puzzle words and see if we can identify a unique characteristic that four of them share. We'll start by saying each word aloud and considering their structure or sound.

1. **MEAT**
2. **SPORTS**
3. **DEMI**
4. **THRUST**
5. **CORE**
6. **SUBSTANCE**
7. **WIRELESS**
8. **PUSH-UP**

Let's consider some potential characteristics:

- **Syllable Count**: Check if any words share the same number of syllables.
- **Phonetic Patterns**: Look for rhymes, alliteration, or similar sounds.
- **Word Structure**: Consider prefixes, suffixes, or compound words.
- **Letter Patterns**: Look for words with the same starting or ending letters.

### Step 1: Initial Observations

- **Compound Words**: "SPORTS" and "PUSH-UP" are compound words. Let's see if there are more.
- **Hyphenated Words**: "PUSH-UP" is hyphenated. Check for others.
- **Prefixes/Suffixes**: "WIRELESS" has a suffix "-less". Check for others.
- **Syllable Count**: Let's count syllables:
  - MEAT (1)
  - SPORTS (1)
  - DEMI (2)
  - THRUST (1)
  - CORE (1)
  - SUBSTANCE (2)
  - WIRELESS (2)
  - PUSH-UP (2)

### Step 2: Explore Patterns

- **Compound Words**: "SPORTS" and "PUSH-UP" are compound words. Let's see if "WIRELESS" and "SUBSTANCE" can fit this pattern.
  - "WIRELESS" is a compound word (WIRE + LESS).
  - "SUBSTANCE" is not a compound word.

- **Hyphenated Words**: Only "PUSH-UP" is hyphenated.

- **Words with Suffixes**: "WIRELESS" has a suffix "-less". Check for others.
  - None of the other words have a similar suffix.

- **Syllable Count**: Words with two syllables: "DEMI", "SUBSTANCE", "WIRELESS", "PUSH-UP".

### Step 3: Form a Group

Based on the syllable count, let's consider the two-syllable words:

- **DEMI**
- **SUBSTANCE**
- **WIRELESS**
- **PUSH-UP**

These words all have two syllables. Let's see if this pattern holds:

- **DEMI**: 2 syllables
- **SUBSTANCE**: 2 syllables
- **WIRELESS**: 2 syllables
- **PUSH-UP**: 2 syllables

This is a potential group based on syllable count. Let's propose this as a possible solution and see if it fits the pattern the puzzle requires. If not, we can explore other characteristics.

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's start by examining the list of puzzle words: CORE, SUBSTANCE, WIRELESS, MEAT, THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, DEMI.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category.

1. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: These could both relate to something fundamental or essential, but it's a bit broad.
2. **WIRELESS and SPORTS**: These don't seem to fit together in a specific category.
3. **MEAT and CORE**: These don't seem to fit together in a specific category.
4. **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: These could both relate to physical actions or exercises.
5. **DEMI and SUBSTANCE**: These don't seem to fit together in a specific category.

Let's focus on **THRUST and PUSH-UP** as they both relate to physical actions or exercises.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category.

- **CORE**: This could also relate to physical exercises, as "core" exercises are common in fitness.
- **SPORTS**: This fits well within the category of physical activities or exercises.

So, we have a potential category: "Physical exercises or activities."

Possible group of four puzzle words: **CORE, THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS**

Let's consider if this category is unique or subtle enough for a New York Times puzzle. It might be a bit broad, but it's worth considering.

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or category. Let me know if you want to explore other possibilities!

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's break down the puzzle words and see if we can identify any patterns or connections between them. We need to find four words that are each a way to do the same thing.

1. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise, specifically a bodyweight exercise that targets the upper body.
2. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without physical connections, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
3. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games, often competitive, that involve skill and physical exertion.
4. **CORE**: This can refer to the central part of something, or in fitness, exercises that target the core muscles.
5. **SUBSTANCE**: This refers to a particular kind of matter with uniform properties.
6. **THRUST**: This means to push or drive with force.
7. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half or partial.
8. **MEAT**: This refers to the flesh of an animal used as food.

Let's try to identify two words that are each a way to do the same thing:

- **PUSH-UP** and **CORE**: Both relate to exercises, specifically targeting the body. A push-up is a type of exercise, and core exercises target the core muscles.
- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both involve a pushing motion or force.

Now, let's see if we can find other words that fit with these:

- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP** both involve a pushing action. 
- **WIRELESS** and **CORE** don't seem to fit with the pushing action.
- **SPORTS** could involve pushing in some contexts, but it's too broad.
- **SUBSTANCE**, **DEMI**, and **MEAT** don't seem to fit with the pushing action.

Let's try another angle:

- **CORE** and **PUSH-UP** both relate to fitness and exercises.
- **SPORTS** could fit with fitness and exercises.
- **THRUST** doesn't fit with fitness directly, but it involves physical exertion.

Possible group related to fitness/exercise:
- **PUSH-UP**
- **CORE**
- **SPORTS**

We need one more word that fits with fitness/exercise:

- **THRUST** could fit if we consider it as a physical action, but it's not specific to fitness.
- **WIRELESS**, **SUBSTANCE**, **DEMI**, and **MEAT** don't fit with fitness/exercise.

It seems we're struggling to find a fourth word that fits the pattern of fitness/exercise. Let's try another pattern or see if there's another angle we haven't considered. If you have any other ideas or want to try a different approach, let me know!

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives.

1. **CORE**: As an adjective, "core" can mean central or essential.
2. **SUBSTANCE**: As an adjective, "substantial" can mean essential or fundamental.

These two words can be synonymous in the sense of being central or essential.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words identified.

3. **MEAT**: As an adjective, "meaty" can mean substantial or significant, which aligns with "core" and "substance" in terms of being essential or fundamental.
4. **THRUST**: As an adjective, "thrust" doesn't directly fit, but if we consider "thrust" in terms of its core meaning, it can imply a central or main point, which can be seen as essential.

Let's see if we can find a better fit for the fourth word:

- **DEMI**: As an adjective, "demi" means half or partial, which doesn't fit with the theme of essential or central.
- **WIRELESS**: As an adjective, "wireless" doesn't fit the theme of essential or central.
- **PUSH-UP**: As an adjective, "push-up" doesn't fit the theme of essential or central.
- **SPORTS**: As an adjective, "sporty" doesn't fit the theme of essential or central.

It seems like we have a potential group with "CORE," "SUBSTANCE," and "MEAT," but we need a fourth word that fits the theme of being essential or central. Let's try another approach:

- **THRUST**: If we consider "thrust" as the main point or essence, it could fit with "core," "substance," and "meat."

So, a possible group of four words could be: CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST.

If this doesn't work, we might need to explore other patterns or combinations. Let me know if you want to try another approach or if there's anything else I can do to help!
