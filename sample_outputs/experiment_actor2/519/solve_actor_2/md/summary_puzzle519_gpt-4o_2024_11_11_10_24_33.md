### Guess 8

Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words THRUST, CORE, MEAT, and SUBSTANCE are connected by the concept of "essence" or "central part." Each word can metaphorically refer to the main point, central part, or essential nature of something.

### Guess 9

Rejected because no good options for guess: Let's carefully evaluate the potential connections for the words provided and determine if any of the guesses are strong enough to submit.

1. **DEMI**, **LADY**, **BIG**, **EARLY**: The suggested connection is that these words can function as adjectives or descriptors that modify nouns. While this is true, the connection is quite generic and not unique enough to be a strong guess. Many words can serve as adjectives or modifiers, so this connection lacks the specificity typically required for a New York Times connections puzzle.

Let's explore other possible connections among the remaining words:

- **SUBSTANCE**, **MEAT**, **CORE**, **THRUST**: These words could potentially relate to the idea of "essence" or "central part." However, "THRUST" might not fit as cleanly into this category as the others.

- **THRUST**, **PUSH-UP**, **SPORTS**, **WIRELESS**: These words could relate to physical activities or exercises, but "WIRELESS" doesn't fit this category.

- **SUE**, **SPORTS**, **WIRELESS**, **PUSH-UP**: These words don't seem to form a coherent or specific connection.

- **DEMI**, **LADY**, **BIG**, **EARLY**: As previously discussed, this connection is too generic.

Given the analysis, none of the connections seem strong or specific enough to submit confidently. The connection involving adjectives or descriptors is too broad, and the other potential connections don't fit all four words cleanly.

**Decision:**
We should go back to brainstorming other possible connections. The current guesses lack the specificity and uniqueness required for a strong submission. Let's explore other potential connections or combinations of words that might reveal a more precise and unique relationship.

### Guess 10

Guess: CORE LADY MEAT SPORTS

Reasoning:
The words LADY, MEAT, CORE, and SPORTS are connected by the fact that each can be preceded by the word "BIG" to form common phrases (e.g., BIG LADY, BIG MEAT, BIG CORE, BIG SPORTS). This connection is specific and unique, highlighting a pattern where "BIG" is a fitting prefix for each word.

### Guess 11

Submitted and Correct: Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words "CORE," "MEAT," "SUBSTANCE," and "THRUST" are connected by the theme of representing the essence or main part of something. Each word signifies a central or fundamental component, highlighting their shared connection.

### Guess 12

Submitted and Correct: Guess: BIG EARLY LADY SUE

Reasoning:
The words "BIG," "EARLY," "LADY," and "SUE" are all connected because they can modify the word "BIRD," forming phrases like "Big bird," "Early bird," "Ladybird," and "Sue Bird." This connection involves both common phrases and a pop culture reference.

### Guess 13

Guess: CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST WIRELESS

Reasoning:
The words CORE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, and THRUST are connected through the theme of "essence" or "central part." CORE and SUBSTANCE directly relate to this theme, while THRUST can be seen as the main point or force, and WIRELESS suggests communication without the "core" of wires, tying into the idea of centrality.

### Guess 14

Guess: CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST

Reasoning:
The words "CORE," "PUSH-UP," "SPORTS," and "THRUST" are connected through their association with physical activities and exercises. "Push-up" and "Thrust" are specific exercises, "Core" relates to exercises targeting core muscles, and "Sports" encompasses a broad category of physical activities.

### Guess 15

Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words "CORE," "SUBSTANCE," "MEAT," and "THRUST" are connected by the concept of being essential or central. Each word can imply something that is fundamental or significant, such as "core" and "substance" meaning central, "meaty" meaning substantial, and "thrust" implying a main point.

### Guess 16

Rejected because no good options for guess: Let's analyze the words again and see if we can find a strong connection among them. We need to find a group of four words that share a unique and specific connection.

1. **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise.
2. **DEMI**: Could refer to "demi" meaning half or partial, or it could be a name.
3. **WIRELESS**: Refers to technology that operates without wires, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
4. **SUBSTANCE**: A general term that can refer to a material or matter.
5. **CORE**: Can refer to the central part of something, or in fitness, it refers to the muscles of the torso.
6. **MEAT**: A type of food, specifically animal flesh.
7. **SPORTS**: Refers to physical activities or games.
8. **THRUST**: Can refer to a forceful push or movement.

Let's try to find a connection:

- **PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS, THRUST**: These words could relate to physical fitness or exercise. However, this guess was already identified as incorrect in the notes.

- **DEMI, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, MEAT**: It's challenging to find a specific connection among these words. They don't seem to fit into a clear category or share a unique characteristic.

- **CORE, THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS**: This was the initial guess, but it was incorrect.

Given the constraints and the words provided, it seems we don't have a strong alternative guess that fits the criteria. The notes only provided one potential solution, which was already incorrect. Without additional context or words, it's difficult to form a new viable guess.

Since the notes didn't provide any other viable solutions and the initial guess was incorrect, we might need to reconsider the words or look for a different angle. However, based on the information provided, we don't have enough to form a new, strong guess.

Based on the analysis, I recommend going back to brainstorming other possible connections. We don't have a strong guess to submit at this time. Let's look for additional clues or reconsider the context to find a viable solution.

### Guess 17

Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE, and THRUST are connected by the idea of being the main part or essence of something. Each word represents a kind of "essence" or "central part."

### Guess 18

Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words "CORE," "MEAT," "SUBSTANCE," and "THRUST" are connected by the concept of the "main part" or "essence" of something. Each word represents an essential or central component within its respective context.

### Guess 19

Rejected because no good options for guess: Let's carefully analyze the notes and the words provided to determine if there's a strong guess to submit.

From the notes, we have the following possible guesses:

1. **WIRELESS, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, CORE**: This group was considered but "wireless" felt out of place compared to the others, which are more directly related to physical exercises.

2. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, PUSH-UP**: This group was identified as having a strong connection related to physical fitness or exercise, as all words can be related to physical exertion or fitness activities.

3. **WIRELESS, SPORTS, THRUST, PUSH-UP**: This group was considered but "wireless" again felt slightly out of place compared to the others.

The notes indicate that the guess **CORE, DEMI, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** was incorrect. Therefore, we should not submit this guess.

Given the analysis, the group **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, PUSH-UP** was identified as having the strongest connection related to physical fitness or exercise. However, since the notes indicate that **CORE, DEMI, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** was incorrect, and considering the potential overlap in themes, it's possible that the connection we identified might not be correct either.

Since the notes suggest that the guess **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, PUSH-UP** was not explicitly marked as incorrect, and it was identified as the strongest connection, it might still be worth considering. However, given the uncertainty and the fact that a similar guess was incorrect, it might be prudent to go back to brainstorming other possible connections.

In conclusion, I recommend going back to brainstorming other possible connections, as the current options do not provide a sufficiently strong guess to submit with confidence.

### Guess 20

Guess: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
The words CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE, and THRUST all metaphorically refer to the central or main part of something. They are synonymous in the context of representing the essence or primary component of an object or concept.
