Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words are each a way to do the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each a way to remove hair: SHAVE THREAD TWEEZE WAX
Puzzle words that are each a way to preserve food: CAN CURE DRY FREEZE
Puzzle words that are each a way to get attention: SHOUT SNAP WAVE WHISTLE
Puzzle words that are each a way to say “I give!”: ENOUGH MERCY STOP UNCLE
Puzzle words that are each a way to say “Step on it!": FASTER GO HURRY MOVE
Puzzle words that are each a way to preserve a meat: CANS CURES SALTS SMOKES
Puzzle words that are each a way to say “My mistake!”: APOLOGIES OOPS PARDON SORRY
Puzzle words that are each a way to say a win is assured: CLINCH GUARANTEE LOCK SECURE
Puzzle words that are each a way to take a tumble: FALL SLIP SPILL TRIP
Puzzle words that are each a slang way to say “head” using food words: BEAN MELON NOODLE NUT

Step 2: See if other puzzle words are also a way to do that same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE WIRELESS THRUST SPORTS MEAT CORE BIG SUBSTANCE PUSH-UP PAYDAY CRUNCH DOVE DEMI MARS EARLY LADY

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying a pattern where four words are each a way to do the same thing.

1. **Identify potential pairs:**
   - **THRUST and PUSH-UP:** Both involve pushing or exerting force.
   - **CRUNCH and PUSH-UP:** Both are exercises.
   - **WIRELESS and CORE:** Both can relate to technology (wireless technology, core technology).
   - **SUE and PAYDAY:** Both relate to legal/financial outcomes (suing for money, payday as receiving money).

2. **Explore potential patterns:**
   - **Exercise-related words:** CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST. We need one more exercise-related word.
   - **Financial/legal outcomes:** SUE, PAYDAY. We need two more words related to financial/legal outcomes.
   - **Technology-related words:** WIRELESS, CORE. We need two more technology-related words.

3. **Re-evaluate and expand:**
   - **Exercise-related words:** CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, and possibly SPORTS (as it relates to physical activity).
   - **Financial/legal outcomes:** SUE, PAYDAY. We need to find more words that fit this category.
   - **Technology-related words:** WIRELESS, CORE. We need to find more words that fit this category.

4. **Consider other potential patterns:**
   - **Ways to exert force or pressure:** THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH. We need one more word that fits this pattern.
   - **Ways to describe something small or compact:** DEMI (meaning half or small), CORE (central part, often small), SUBSTANCE (can refer to a small amount of something), and possibly CRUNCH (as in a crunch time, a small window of time).

5. **Final attempt to find a group of four:**
   - **Exercise-related words:** CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, SPORTS.
   - **Ways to exert force or pressure:** THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, possibly SPORTS (as sports can involve physical exertion).

Based on the brainstorming, the most promising group of four words that match a pattern are exercise-related: CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, SPORTS. These words all relate to physical activity or exercises. 

If this doesn't seem correct, we can try another pattern or re-evaluate the words. Let me know if you want to explore another angle!

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous adjectives.

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words That Can Be Synonymous Adjectives

1. **BIG**: This can be an adjective meaning large or significant.
2. **EARLY**: This can be an adjective meaning happening or done before the usual or expected time.

These two words don't seem to be synonymous, so let's try another pair.

1. **CORE**: This can be an adjective meaning central or essential.
2. **SUBSTANCE**: This can be an adjective meaning substantial or significant.

Again, these don't seem to match as synonyms. Let's try another pair.

1. **DEMI**: This can be an adjective meaning half or partial.
2. **LADY**: This can be an adjective meaning refined or elegant.

These don't match either. Let's try another pair.

1. **WIRELESS**: This can be an adjective meaning without wires or cordless.
2. **SPORTS**: This can be an adjective meaning athletic or related to sports.

These don't match either. Let's try another pair.

1. **THRUST**: This can be an adjective meaning forceful or vigorous.
2. **CRUNCH**: This can be an adjective meaning critical or decisive.

These don't match either. Let's try another pair.

1. **SUE**: This can be an adjective meaning litigious or legal.
2. **DOVE**: This can be an adjective meaning peaceful or gentle.

These don't match either. Let's try another pair.

1. **PAYDAY**: This can be an adjective meaning lucrative or profitable.
2. **MEAT**: This can be an adjective meaning substantial or significant.

These don't match either. Let's try another pair.

### Step 2: See If Other Puzzle Words Can Also Be Synonymous

Let's try to find a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives:

1. **BIG**: Large, significant.
2. **CORE**: Central, essential.
3. **SUBSTANCE**: Substantial, significant.
4. **MEAT**: Substantial, significant.

These words don't all match as synonyms. Let's try another group.

1. **THRUST**: Forceful, vigorous.
2. **CRUNCH**: Critical, decisive.
3. **PUSH-UP**: Forceful, vigorous.
4. **SPORTS**: Athletic, vigorous.

These words don't all match as synonyms. Let's try another group.

1. **WIRELESS**: Cordless, without wires.
2. **EARLY**: Premature, ahead of time.
3. **DEMI**: Partial, half.
4. **LADY**: Refined, elegant.

These words don't all match as synonyms. Let's try another group.

### Conclusion

After going through the list, I couldn't find a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other. It might be worth trying another pattern or looking for more unique or specific synonyms. Let me know if you want to try a different approach or pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous.

Examples from prior puzzles:

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: EARLY SUE BIG MEAT MARS PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE DOVE PAYDAY DEMI THRUST SPORTS CRUNCH LADY CORE WIRELESS

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding synonyms that function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms.

1. **EARLY**: This is an adjective meaning "before the usual or expected time."
2. **BIG**: This is an adjective meaning "large in size or extent."

These two words don't seem to be synonymous, so let's try another pair.

1. **THRUST**: This can be a verb meaning "to push with force."
2. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun referring to an exercise, but if we consider "PUSH" as a verb, it can mean "to apply force to move something."

These two words can be synonymous as verbs meaning "to apply force."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.

Let's look for other words that can be synonymous with "THRUST" and "PUSH" as verbs:

1. **CRUNCH**: This can be a verb meaning "to crush with a noisy crackling sound," but it doesn't quite fit the "apply force" meaning.
2. **SUE**: This is a verb meaning "to take legal action," which doesn't fit.
3. **WIRELESS**: This is an adjective, so it doesn't fit.
4. **DEMI**: This is an adjective meaning "half" or "partly," so it doesn't fit.
5. **CORE**: This can be a verb meaning "to remove the central part," but it doesn't fit the "apply force" meaning.
6. **SPORTS**: This is a noun, so it doesn't fit.
7. **LADY**: This is a noun, so it doesn't fit.
8. **PAYDAY**: This is a noun, so it doesn't fit.
9. **MARS**: This is a noun, so it doesn't fit.
10. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a noun, so it doesn't fit.
11. **DOVE**: This can be a verb (past tense of "dive"), but it doesn't fit the "apply force" meaning.

It seems challenging to find four words that fit the pattern of being synonymous verbs meaning "to apply force." Let's try another approach.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms.

1. **BIG**: Adjective meaning "large in size or extent."
2. **DEMI**: Adjective meaning "half" or "partly," which doesn't fit.

Let's try another pair.

1. **CORE**: This can be a noun meaning "the central or most important part."
2. **SUBSTANCE**: This can be a noun meaning "the essential nature or most important part of something."

These two words can be synonymous as nouns meaning "the essential part."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.

Let's look for other words that can be synonymous with "CORE" and "SUBSTANCE" as nouns:

1. **MEAT**: This can be a noun meaning "the flesh of an animal," but it can also mean "the essential part of something," fitting the pattern.
2. **CRUNCH**: This is more of an action or sound, so it doesn't fit.
3. **SPORTS**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
4. **LADY**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
5. **PAYDAY**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
6. **MARS**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
7. **DOVE**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
8. **WIRELESS**: This is an adjective, so it doesn't fit.
9. **THRUST**: This is a verb, so it doesn't fit.
10. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
11. **SUE**: This is a verb, so it doesn't fit.
12. **EARLY**: This is an adjective, so it doesn't fit.

We have identified three words: CORE, SUBSTANCE, and MEAT, that can be synonymous as nouns meaning "the essential part." Unfortunately, we couldn't find a fourth word that fits this pattern.

If we can't find a fourth word, we might need to consider a different pattern or re-evaluate the list for other potential synonyms. Let me know if you want to try another approach or if there's anything else I can do to help.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same set of letters

Steps to take: 

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm letters or words that can follow each word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular sets of letters or words rather than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “berry”: BLUE GOOSE RASP STRAW
Puzzle words that are each followed by “land countries”: ICE IRE FIN NETHER
Puzzle words that are each followed by “-o”: DADDY DAY JACKIE JELL

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same set of letters or words that can follow them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular sets of letters or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words. 

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have that same set of letters or word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same set of letters or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are different aspects of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. Describe the connection between the puzzle words as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST CRUNCH WIRELESS SUE PUSH-UP DOVE MARS DEMI BIG EARLY LADY PAYDAY SUBSTANCE MEAT SPORTS CORE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying connections between the words that could represent different aspects of the same thing.

1. **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: Both words relate to force or movement. "Thrust" is a forceful push, and "push-up" is an exercise involving pushing one's body up.

2. **CRUNCH and CORE**: Both words can relate to fitness. "Crunch" is an exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, and "core" refers to the central muscles of the body, including the abdominals.

3. **WIRELESS and EARLY**: These words don't seem to have a direct connection. Let's set them aside for now.

4. **SUE and PAYDAY**: "Sue" involves legal action, often for financial compensation, which could lead to a "payday" if the lawsuit is successful.

5. **DOVE and LADY**: Both words can be associated with peace and gentleness. "Dove" is a symbol of peace, and "lady" can imply grace and gentility.

6. **MARS and SPORTS**: "Mars" is the Roman god of war, and "sports" can be seen as a form of competitive combat or battle.

7. **DEMI and BIG**: "Demi" means half or partial, while "big" refers to size. These words don't seem to connect directly.

8. **SUBSTANCE and MEAT**: Both words can refer to the essential part of something. "Substance" is the essential nature, and "meat" can be the core or main part of a discussion or argument.

Now, let's try to form a group of four words that are different aspects of the same thing:

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE**: These words all relate to aspects of physical fitness or exercise, specifically involving strength and core workouts.

This seems like a plausible solution. If this doesn't fit the intended pattern, we can explore other combinations. Let me know if you need further assistance or if we should try another pattern.
