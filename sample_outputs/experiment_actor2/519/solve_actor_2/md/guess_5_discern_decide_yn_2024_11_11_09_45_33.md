system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully evaluate the notes and the words provided to determine if we have a strong guess to submit.

From the notes, we have two strong guesses:

1. **PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE, THRUST**: These words are all related to exercises or movements. This connection is strong because each word fits well within the context of physical exercises.

2. **CRUNCH, PAYDAY, LADY, SPORTS**: These words can each follow the word "BIG" to form common phrases: "big crunch," "big payday," "big lady," and "big sports." This is a strong connection because it forms common phrases with "big."

Both guesses are strong, but guess #2 (CRUNCH, PAYDAY, LADY, SPORTS) has a more unique and specific connection, which is often favored in New York Times puzzles.

Let's check if all the words for guess #2 are present in the list:
- CRUNCH: Present
- PAYDAY: Present
- LADY: Present
- SPORTS: Present

All four words for guess #2 are present in the list, and the connection is strong and specific.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess: **Words that each come after the word “BIG”: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, LADY, SPORTS.**

This guess seems to be the strongest and most likely to be correct based on the notes and the nature of the puzzle.
