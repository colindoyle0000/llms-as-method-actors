system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's evaluate the notes and the words provided to determine if we should submit a guess.

From the notes, we have two strong potential solutions:

1. **EARLY, BIG, LADY, SUE** - These words can all modify "BIRD": "Early bird," "Big bird," "Ladybird," and "Sue Bird." This connection is strong and unique, involving both common phrases and a pop culture reference.

2. **DEMI, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, WIRELESS** - These words are all types of bras: "Demi-cup bra," "Sports bra," "Push-up bra," and "Wireless bra." This connection is also strong and consistent.

Given the list of words you provided: PUSH-UP, EARLY, LADY, SPORTS, BIG, SUE, WIRELESS, DEMI, we can see that both of these potential solutions are present.

However, the notes suggest that the connection with "BIRD" (EARLY, BIG, LADY, SUE) is particularly unique and clever, making it slightly more compelling.

Therefore, based on the notes and the evaluation, I recommend submitting the guess for **EARLY, BIG, LADY, SUE** as words that can all modify "BIRD." This is a strong and unique connection that fits well with the puzzle's requirements.
