## Prompts

system: ""”

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 The following guesses were incorrect: 
CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS


Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's work through this step by step to find a possible solution to the puzzle.

**Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm prefixes or words that can come before each puzzle word.**

- **CORE** - hard, soft, apple
- **SUBSTANCE** - controlled, illegal, active
- **THRUST** - forward, main, powerful
- **PUSH-UP** - standard, modified, incline
- **MEAT** - red, lean, processed
- **WIRELESS** - connection, network, technology
- **SPORTS** - team, extreme, professional
- **DEMI** - semi, half, god

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that can have the same prefix or word come before them.**

Let's look for common prefixes or words that can precede multiple puzzle words:

- **Main**: THRUST, SUBSTANCE
- **Lean**: MEAT, THRUST
- **Team**: SPORTS, THRUST
- **Half**: DEMI, MEAT

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same prefix or word, trying to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each have the same prefix or word.**

Let's explore these possibilities:

- **Main**: THRUST, SUBSTANCE
  - No other words seem to fit well with "main."

- **Lean**: MEAT, THRUST
  - No other words seem to fit well with "lean."

- **Team**: SPORTS, THRUST
  - No other words seem to fit well with "team."

- **Half**: DEMI, MEAT
  - No other words seem to fit well with "half."

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a group of four words that fit the same prefix or word pattern. Let's try another approach or pattern. If you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern you want to explore, let me know!

### Step 2: Identify a connection between the words that you’ve brainstormed that applies to multiple puzzle words.

Let's try to find a common theme or connection among the words that are one letter away from the puzzle words. 

- **WIRELESS**: Could be related to technology or communication.
- **DEMI**: Could be related to size or partiality.
- **SPORTS**: Could be related to activities or games.
- **MEAT**: Could be related to food or protein.
- **PUSH-UP**: Could be related to exercise or fitness.
- **CORE**: Could be related to centrality or fitness.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Could be related to material or essence.
- **THRUST**: Could be related to force or movement.

### Step 3: See if other puzzle words can share the connection, trying to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each one letter away from a word that shares something else in common.

Let's try to find a group of four words that share a common theme or connection:

1. **WIRELESS**: Technology/Communication
2. **SPORTS**: Activities/Games
3. **PUSH-UP**: Exercise/Fitness
4. **CORE**: Centrality/Fitness

These four words could potentially share a connection related to fitness or physical activity. 

Let's try this combination: **WIRELESS, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, CORE**

If this doesn't work, we can try another combination or pattern. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if you want to try a different approach.
 *** 

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We need to find a subtle connection between four of these words. Let's start by examining each word and see if we can find any connections.

1. **MEAT**: This could refer to food, protein, or the flesh of an animal.
2. **WIRELESS**: This could relate to technology, communication, or devices that operate without wires.
3. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to material, matter, or the essence of something.
4. **CORE**: This could mean the central part of something, like the core of the Earth, or the essence of an idea.
5. **THRUST**: This could relate to force, propulsion, or movement.
6. **SPORTS**: This could refer to physical activities, games, or competitions.
7. **PUSH-UP**: This is an exercise, but it could also relate to movement or force.
8. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half, but it could also relate to something partial or incomplete.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can relate to the essence or central part of something.
- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both involve force or movement.
- **WIRELESS** and **SPORTS**: Both can relate to modern technology, as wireless technology is often used in sports for communication and tracking.
- **MEAT** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can refer to something tangible or material.

Let's see if we can find a group of four words that relate to the same thing:

- **CORE**, **SUBSTANCE**, **THRUST**, **PUSH-UP**: These could all relate to physical fitness or exercise. "Core" exercises, "substance" as in building muscle, "thrust" as a movement, and "push-up" as a specific exercise.

This is a potential group that could fit the pattern. However, since "CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS" was incorrect, let's try another approach:

- **WIRELESS**, **SPORTS**, **THRUST**, **PUSH-UP**: These could relate to modern sports technology. Wireless technology is used in sports, thrust and push-up are movements or actions in sports.

If this doesn't work, we might need to consider another pattern or connection. Let me know if you want to explore another angle or if you have any other ideas!
 *** 

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying a group of four puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing.

1. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to types of technology or communication methods, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.

2. **CORE**: This could refer to types of central parts or essential elements, such as nucleus, center, etc.

3. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to types of materials or matter, such as liquid, solid, gas, etc.

4. **SPORTS**: This could refer to types of physical activities or games, such as soccer, basketball, etc.

5. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise, specifically a bodyweight exercise.

6. **THRUST**: This could refer to types of force or movement, such as push, shove, etc.

7. **MEAT**: This could refer to types of animal flesh used for food, such as beef, chicken, pork, etc.

8. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half, but it could also refer to types of portions or sizes, such as demi-glace, demi-tasse, etc.

Now, let's try to find a common category:

- **WIRELESS** and **THRUST** don't seem to fit well with the others.
- **CORE**, **SUBSTANCE**, and **MEAT** could potentially fit into a category related to essential elements or components.
- **SPORTS** and **PUSH-UP** are related to physical activities or exercises.

Let's focus on the potential category of exercises or physical activities:

- **SPORTS**: Types of physical activities.
- **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise.
- **THRUST**: Could be related to a type of movement or exercise.
- **CORE**: Often used to describe exercises targeting the central muscles of the body.

This gives us a potential group: **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**. However, this was already guessed and found incorrect.

Let's try another angle:

- **WIRELESS**: Types of communication methods.
- **CORE**: Types of central parts.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Types of materials.
- **MEAT**: Types of food.

These don't seem to fit together well either.

Let's try focusing on **MEAT**:

- **MEAT**: Types of animal flesh.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Types of materials or matter.
- **CORE**: Types of central parts.
- **DEMI**: Types of portions or sizes.

This doesn't seem to fit either.

Let's try another approach:

- **WIRELESS**: Types of communication.
- **CORE**: Types of central parts.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Types of materials.
- **DEMI**: Types of portions.

This doesn't seem to fit either.

Let's try focusing on **THRUST**:

- **THRUST**: Types of force or movement.
- **PUSH-UP**: Types of exercises.
- **SPORTS**: Types of physical activities.
- **CORE**: Types of exercises.

This doesn't seem to fit either.

It seems like we're having trouble finding a group of four words that fit the pattern. Let's try another pattern or approach. If you have any other ideas or words to focus on, let me know!
 *** 

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's go through the steps to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match the pattern: puzzle words that each come after the same word or phrase.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**DEMI** - semi, demi-god, demi-glace

**WIRELESS** - bluetooth, wireless network, wireless connection

**MEAT** - red, white, ground, processed

**SPORTS** - team, extreme, water, motor

**CORE** - apple, hard, soft, nuclear

**THRUST** - rocket, engine, main, forward

**PUSH-UP** - exercise, bra, push-up bar

**SUBSTANCE** - chemical, controlled, illegal, physical

**Step 2: Puzzle words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Let's identify any common words or phrases that can precede multiple puzzle words:

- **Demi**: Not much overlap with others.
- **Wireless**: Not much overlap with others.
- **Meat**: Not much overlap with others.
- **Sports**: Not much overlap with others.
- **Core**: Not much overlap with others.
- **Thrust**: Not much overlap with others.
- **Push-up**: Not much overlap with others.
- **Substance**: Not much overlap with others.

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same word come before them**

Let's try to find a common word or phrase that can precede at least four of these puzzle words:

- **Core** and **Thrust**: Both can be preceded by "rocket" (rocket core, rocket thrust).
- **Core** and **Substance**: Both can be preceded by "nuclear" (nuclear core, nuclear substance).
- **Push-up** and **Sports**: Both can be preceded by "exercise" (exercise push-up, exercise sports).

Unfortunately, I am not finding a common word or phrase that can precede four of these puzzle words. Let's try another approach or pattern if this one doesn't yield a solution. If you have any other ideas or patterns to explore, let me know!
 *** 


Your response should consist of each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
