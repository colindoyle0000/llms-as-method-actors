Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can each be a part of a different word within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories. As precisely as possible, describe how each of the two puzzle words can be part of a different word within the same category.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the first letters of a zodiac sign: CAN GEM LIB TAU
Puzzle words that are each the first letters of the name of a planet: EAR MAR MER SAT
Puzzle words that each start with letters that form the name of a rock band: CREAMSICLE JOURNEYMAN KISSCAM RUSHMORE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can be part of different words within that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST PUSH-UP MEAT SUBSTANCE SPORTS CORE DEMI WIRELESS

## Output

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We need to find a pattern where four of these words can be parts of different words within the same category. Let's start by examining each word and see if we can identify any potential categories they might fit into.

1. **THRUST**: This could be related to movement or force. It might also be part of a compound word or phrase, like "thrust vector" in aerospace.

2. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise, but it could also be part of a phrase like "push-up bra."

3. **MEAT**: This is a type of food, but it could also be part of a phrase like "meat market."

4. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a broad term that could relate to chemistry or materials, like "substance abuse."

5. **SPORTS**: This is a category in itself, but it could also be part of a phrase like "sports car."

6. **CORE**: This could relate to the center of something, like "core values" or "core muscles."

7. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half, used in words like "demigod" or "demitasse."

8. **WIRELESS**: This relates to technology, like "wireless network."

Now, let's try to find a category that could link four of these words together:

- **Exercise/Physical Activity**: "THRUST" (as in thrust exercises), "PUSH-UP" (a type of exercise), "CORE" (core exercises), and "SPORTS" (physical activity).

- **Food/Drink**: "MEAT" (food), "DEMI" (as in demitasse, a small cup of coffee), "SUBSTANCE" (could be a stretch, but thinking of food substances), and "CORE" (as in apple core).

- **Technology**: "WIRELESS" (technology), "CORE" (as in processor core), "THRUST" (as in thrust vectoring in aerospace technology), and "SUBSTANCE" (as in material substance, though this is a bit of a stretch).

The most promising category seems to be **Exercise/Physical Activity** with "THRUST," "PUSH-UP," "CORE," and "SPORTS." Let's see if this combination fits the pattern:

- **THRUST**: Could be part of exercises involving thrust movements.
- **PUSH-UP**: A specific exercise.
- **CORE**: Refers to exercises targeting core muscles.
- **SPORTS**: General category of physical activities.

This combination seems to fit the pattern of being parts of different words within the same category of exercise or physical activity. Let's go with this as a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can try exploring other categories or combinations.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each modify the same word

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that each puzzle word can modify. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words rather than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each modify “pepper”: BELL BLACK DR GHOST
Puzzle words that each modify “trap”: BEAR SAND SPEED TOURIST
Puzzle words that each modify “hour”: AMATEUR ELEVENTH HAPPY RUSH
Puzzle words that each modify “dream”: AMERICAN FEVER LUCID PIPE
Puzzle words that each modify “bat”: BASEBALL CRICKET FRUIT VAMPIRE

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can each modify the same word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so a unique and particular word being modified is more likely to be correct than a generic and ubiquitous word.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can modify that same word. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each modify the same word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that each modify the same word, start over at Step 2.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE WIRELESS DEMI THRUST SPORTS MEAT CORE PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step. We need to find a word that each of the puzzle words can modify. 

1. **SUBSTANCE**: 
   - Abuse (substance abuse)
   - Control (substance control)
   - Use (substance use)

2. **WIRELESS**: 
   - Network (wireless network)
   - Technology (wireless technology)
   - Connection (wireless connection)

3. **DEMI**: 
   - God (demigod)
   - Moore (Demi Moore)
   - Glace (demi-glace)

4. **THRUST**: 
   - Force (thrust force)
   - Stage (thrust stage)
   - Vector (thrust vector)

5. **SPORTS**: 
   - Car (sports car)
   - Team (sports team)
   - Event (sports event)

6. **MEAT**: 
   - Market (meat market)
   - Loaf (meat loaf)
   - Grinder (meat grinder)

7. **CORE**: 
   - Strength (core strength)
   - Values (core values)
   - Temperature (core temperature)

8. **PUSH-UP**: 
   - Exercise (push-up exercise)
   - Bra (push-up bra)
   - Challenge (push-up challenge)

Now, let's see if we can find a common word that four of these puzzle words can modify:

- **CORE** and **STRENGTH**: Both can modify "strength" (core strength, thrust strength).
- **SPORTS** and **TEAM**: Both can modify "team" (sports team, core team).
- **WIRELESS** and **NETWORK**: Both can modify "network" (wireless network, core network).

Let's try to find a combination of four words:

- **CORE**: Can modify "strength," "team," "network."
- **SPORTS**: Can modify "team."
- **WIRELESS**: Can modify "network."
- **THRUST**: Can modify "strength."

This gives us a potential combination: CORE, SPORTS, WIRELESS, THRUST, all modifying "strength" or "network."

However, we need to find a single word that all four can modify. Let's try another approach:

- **CORE**: Can modify "strength."
- **SPORTS**: Can modify "strength."
- **THRUST**: Can modify "strength."
- **PUSH-UP**: Can modify "strength."

This gives us a potential combination: CORE, SPORTS, THRUST, PUSH-UP, all modifying "strength."

Let's submit this combination and see if it fits the pattern. If not, we can try another approach.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each a kind of a thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. Describe the connection between the puzzle words as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each a kind of organization: CLUB GROUP PARTY TEAM
Puzzle words that are each a kind of shirt: CROP POLO TANK TEE
Puzzle words that are each a kind of bird: CARDINAL JAY LARK SWIFT
Puzzle words that are each a kind of transportation: BOAT CAR PLANE TRAIN
Puzzle words that are each a kind of cartoon mouse: ITCHY JERRY PINKY SPEEDY
Puzzle words that are each a kind of accessory: BELT BRACELET TIE WATCH
Puzzle words that are each a kind of container: BASKET BIN CHEST HAMPER
Puzzle words that are each a kind of circular shape: BAND CIRCLE HOOP RING
Puzzle words that are each a kind of place to shop: MALL MARKET OUTLET STORE
Puzzle words that are each a kind of wrench: ALLEN CRESCENT MONKEY SOCKET

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by being a kind of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST DEMI PUSH-UP CORE SPORTS WIRELESS

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying connections between the puzzle words.

1. **MEAT**: This could be a type of food or protein. It could also refer to something substantial or the main part of something.

2. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a broad term that can refer to any material or matter. It could also mean the essence or main part of something.

3. **THRUST**: This is a forceful push or drive. It could also refer to the main point or essence of an argument.

4. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half. It could also refer to something that is partial or incomplete.

5. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise. It could also refer to something that lifts or supports.

6. **CORE**: This could refer to the central or most important part of something. It could also refer to a type of exercise focusing on the central muscles of the body.

7. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games. It could also refer to a category of entertainment or competition.

8. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without physical connections. It could also refer to a type of communication or network.

Now, let's try to find a connection:

- **MEAT** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can refer to the main part or essence of something.
- **THRUST**: Can also refer to the main point or essence of an argument.
- **CORE**: Refers to the central or most important part of something.

These four words—MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, and CORE—can all be connected by the idea of being the main part or essence of something. 

Let's see if this fits the pattern: Puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing. In this case, they are each a kind of "essence" or "central part."

This seems like a plausible solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another approach.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous nouns.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “sequence”: CHAIN SERIES STRING TRAIN
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “quarrel”: FIGHT ROW SCRAP TIFF
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “portion of profit”: CUT PIECE SHARE TAKE

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE MEAT SPORTS WIRELESS CORE THRUST DEMI PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding synonymous nouns.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words That Can Be Synonymous Nouns

1. **SUBSTANCE**: This can be a noun meaning "material" or "essence."
2. **MEAT**: This can be a noun meaning "flesh" or "substance" in the sense of the core or main part of something.

Both "SUBSTANCE" and "MEAT" can be synonymous in the sense of "core" or "essence."

### Step 2: See If Other Puzzle Words Can Also Be Synonymous

Let's examine the other words:

- **SPORTS**: Typically refers to physical activities or games. Not a direct match with "substance" or "meat."
- **WIRELESS**: Generally refers to technology without wires. Not a direct match.
- **CORE**: This can be a noun meaning "center" or "essence," which aligns with "substance" and "meat."
- **THRUST**: Can mean "force" or "drive," but not directly synonymous with "substance" or "meat."
- **DEMI**: Often means "half" or "partial," not directly synonymous.
- **PUSH-UP**: Refers to an exercise, not directly synonymous.

### Possible Group of Four Synonymous Nouns

From the analysis, the words that can be synonymous in the sense of "core" or "essence" are:

- **SUBSTANCE**
- **MEAT**
- **CORE**

We need one more word to complete the group of four. Unfortunately, none of the remaining words fit the pattern of being synonymous with "core" or "essence."

### Conclusion

We have identified three words that fit the pattern: SUBSTANCE, MEAT, and CORE. However, we need a fourth word to complete the group. Since none of the other words fit, we may need to consider a different pattern or request additional puzzle words to find a complete set of four.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS SUBSTANCE PUSH-UP THRUST MEAT SPORTS DEMI CORE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We need to find a group of four words from the list that can substitute for each other, functioning as the same part of speech. 

1. **Identify potential connections:**

   - **WIRELESS**: Typically an adjective, meaning "without wires."
   - **SUBSTANCE**: Usually a noun, meaning "material" or "essence."
   - **PUSH-UP**: Can be a noun (an exercise) or a verb (to push something up).
   - **THRUST**: Can be a noun (a forceful push) or a verb (to push forcefully).
   - **MEAT**: Usually a noun, meaning "flesh of an animal" or "substance."
   - **SPORTS**: Usually a noun, meaning "physical activities" or "games."
   - **DEMI**: Typically an adjective, meaning "half" or "partial."
   - **CORE**: Can be a noun (central part) or a verb (to remove the core).

2. **Look for potential pairs:**

   - **SUBSTANCE** and **MEAT**: Both can be nouns referring to "material" or "essence."
   - **PUSH-UP** and **THRUST**: Both can be verbs meaning "to push forcefully."
   - **CORE** and **THRUST**: Both can be verbs related to forceful actions (though "core" is more about removal).

3. **Expand to groups of four:**

   - For **SUBSTANCE** and **MEAT**, we need two more nouns that can mean "material" or "essence." None of the other words seem to fit this meaning.
   - For **PUSH-UP** and **THRUST**, we need two more verbs that mean "to push forcefully." None of the other words fit this meaning.
   - For **CORE** and **THRUST**, we need two more verbs related to forceful actions. None of the other words fit this meaning.

4. **Re-evaluate and try another angle:**

   - Let's consider **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can be nouns referring to the "central part" or "essence" of something. 
   - **MEAT** can also fit this group as it can mean the "core" or "substance" of a matter.
   - We need one more word that can fit this meaning. Unfortunately, none of the remaining words seem to fit this pattern.

5. **Conclusion:**

   It seems challenging to find a group of four words that fit a single pattern from the given list. We might need to consider a different pattern or re-evaluate the meanings and parts of speech of the words. If you have any other ideas or patterns, feel free to share them, and we can explore further.
