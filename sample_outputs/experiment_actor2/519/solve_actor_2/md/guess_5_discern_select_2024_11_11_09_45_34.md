You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully evaluate the notes and the words provided to determine if we have a strong guess to submit.

From the notes, we have two strong guesses:

1. **PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE, THRUST**: These words are all related to exercises or movements. This connection is strong because each word fits well within the context of physical exercises.

2. **CRUNCH, PAYDAY, LADY, SPORTS**: These words can each follow the word "BIG" to form common phrases: "big crunch," "big payday," "big lady," and "big sports." This is a strong connection because it forms common phrases with "big."

Both guesses are strong, but guess #2 (CRUNCH, PAYDAY, LADY, SPORTS) has a more unique and specific connection, which is often favored in New York Times puzzles.

Let's check if all the words for guess #2 are present in the list:
- CRUNCH: Present
- PAYDAY: Present
- LADY: Present
- SPORTS: Present

All four words for guess #2 are present in the list, and the connection is strong and specific.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess: **Words that each come after the word “BIG”: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, LADY, SPORTS.**

This guess seems to be the strongest and most likely to be correct based on the notes and the nature of the puzzle./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
