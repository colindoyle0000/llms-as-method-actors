Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can substitute for each other. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can substitute for each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can substitute for each other.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to eat voraciously”: DOWN INHALE SCARF WOLF
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “universal”: BLANKET BROAD GENERAL SWEEPING
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “shared”: COLLECTIVE COMMON JOINT MUTUAL
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to rid of contents”: CLEAR DRAIN EMPTY FLUSH
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “method”: CHANNEL MEANS MEDIUM VEHICLE
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “unlikely (as a chance)”: OUTSIDE REMOTE SLIM SMALL
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “a large amount”: MASS SEA SLEW TON
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to fall in under pressure”: BUCKLE CAVE COLLAPSE GIVE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to express indirectly”: COUCH IMPLY INTIMATE SUGGEST
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to wager”: BET GAMBLE RISK STAKE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also substitute for the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can substitute for each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can substitute for each other, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE WIRELESS SUE THRUST CORE LADY PUSH-UP SPORTS BIG MEAT EARLY DEMI

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We need to find a group of four words from the list that can substitute for each other, functioning as the same part of speech. 

1. **Identify potential connections:**

   - **SUBSTANCE**: Could be a noun meaning "essence" or "material."
   - **WIRELESS**: Could be an adjective meaning "without wires" or a noun referring to wireless technology.
   - **SUE**: Could be a verb meaning "to take legal action."
   - **THRUST**: Could be a verb meaning "to push forcefully" or a noun meaning "a strong push."
   - **CORE**: Could be a noun meaning "central part" or a verb meaning "to remove the core."
   - **LADY**: Could be a noun meaning "woman."
   - **PUSH-UP**: Could be a noun referring to an exercise.
   - **SPORTS**: Could be a noun referring to athletic activities or an adjective meaning "related to sports."
   - **BIG**: Could be an adjective meaning "large."
   - **MEAT**: Could be a noun meaning "flesh of an animal."
   - **EARLY**: Could be an adjective or adverb meaning "before the usual time."
   - **DEMI**: Could be an adjective meaning "half" or a prefix.

2. **Look for words that can substitute for each other:**

   Let's start by identifying two words that can substitute for each other:

   - **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can relate to a forceful movement or action. "Thrust" as a noun can mean a strong push, and "push-up" is a type of exercise involving pushing.

3. **Expand to four words:**

   - **THRUST**, **PUSH-UP**, **CORE**, **SPORTS**: These words can all relate to physical activity or exercise. "Thrust" and "push-up" are directly related to physical movements, "core" can refer to core exercises, and "sports" is a general term for physical activities.

4. **Verify the pattern:**

   - **THRUST**: As a noun, it can mean a strong push or drive, often used in physical contexts.
   - **PUSH-UP**: A noun referring to a physical exercise.
   - **CORE**: As a noun, it can refer to core exercises or the central part of something, often used in fitness.
   - **SPORTS**: As a noun, it refers to physical activities or exercises.

This group of words can substitute for each other in the context of physical activity or exercise, fitting the pattern of being nouns related to physical exertion or fitness. 

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can try another pattern or set of words. Let me know if you want to explore further!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each connect to different meanings of the same word or letter.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that each connect to different meanings of the same word or letter. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how each of the two puzzle words connects to different meanings of the same word or letter.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each connected to different meanings of the word “delivered”: BABY BLOW PACKAGE SPEECH
Puzzle words that are each connected to different meanings of the word “stub”: CIGARETTE PENCIL TICKET TOE
Puzzle words that are each connected to different meanings of the word “mole”: ANIMAL BIRTHMARK SPY UNIT
Puzzle words that are each connected to different meanings of the word “slots”: ATM CASINO SCHEDULE SPATULA
Puzzle words that are each different meanings of the letter “I”: IODINE IOTA MYSELF ONE
Puzzle words that are each different meanings of the letter “K”: KELVIN OKAY POTASSIUM THOUSAND

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can connect to different meanings of the same word or letter. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that each connect to different meanings of the same word.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE CORE LADY WIRELESS DEMI SUBSTANCE PUSH-UP BIG THRUST SPORTS MEAT EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, following the pattern of finding words that connect to different meanings of the same word or letter.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **CORE**: 
   - Core can refer to the central part of something, like the core of an apple.
   - It can also refer to the central or most important part of something, like the core of a problem.

2. **WIRELESS**:
   - Wireless can refer to technology that operates without physical wires, like Wi-Fi.
   - It can also refer to a radio or communication system that doesn't use wires.

### Step 2: Find Other Words

Let's see if we can find other words that connect to different meanings of the same word or letter.

3. **SUBSTANCE**:
   - Substance can refer to a particular kind of matter with uniform properties, like a chemical substance.
   - It can also refer to the essence or most important part of something, like the substance of an argument.

4. **THRUST**:
   - Thrust can refer to the force that propels something forward, like the thrust of a rocket.
   - It can also refer to the main point or essence of an argument, like the thrust of a speech.

### Group of Four Words

- **CORE**: Central part or essence.
- **WIRELESS**: Communication without wires.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Matter or essence.
- **THRUST**: Force or main point.

These words each connect to different meanings of the word "essence" or "central part." 

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can try another combination or start over with a different word. Let me know if you want to explore other possibilities!

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can follow each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words and phrases rather than generic and ubiquitous words and phrases.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “George”: BOY BY CURIOUS SAINT
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Valley”: DEATH HIDDEN SILICON UNCANNY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Crane”: CONSTRUCTION FRASIER PAPER WHOOPING
Puzzle words that are each followed by “up”: AMP FIRE HYPE PUMP
Puzzle words that are each followed by “jam”: NBA PAPER PEARL TRAFFIC
Puzzle words that are each followed by “bear”: BOO-BOO BROWN HONEY TEDDY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “chip”: BLUE COMPUTER POKER POTATO
Puzzle words that are each followed by “wheel”: CHEESE COLOR HAMSTER PRAYER

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same word or phrase that follows them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words and phrases are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same word or phrase. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CROP CURIOUS BAD TANK GEE FLY BEE FRESH TEE RAD EX JAY BOY POLO BY SAINT

Output:

To tackle this puzzle effectively, let's begin by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **CROP** - dust, circles, top, rotation
- **CURIOUS** - George, case, about, nature
- **BAD** - news, influence, boy, habit
- **TANK** - top, engine, battle, fish
- **GEE** - whiz, thanks, golly, willikers
- **FLY** - swatter, fishing, high, away
- **BEE** - hive, line, pollen, movie
- **FRESH** - air, produce, start, prince
- **TEE** - shirt, time, off, ball
- **RAD** - tech, radiation, cool, level
- **EX** - wife, husband, file, change
- **JAY** - bird, walk, Z, blue
- **BOY** - scout, friend, George, band
- **POLO** - shirt, match, water, club
- **BY** - pass, law, product, George
- **SAINT** - Bernard, Mary, George, Nicholas

### Observations:

Observing a connection here with the word "George", as it follows CURIOUS (from the character Curious George), BOY (from the character Boy George), SAINT (Saint George), and BY (like in a phrase, although a bit of a stretch). Here's a pattern match:

**Pattern:** Words that are each followed by “George”

- CURIOUS
- BOY
- SAINT
- BY

Now, let's test another set of puzzle words:

1. **BAD** - followed by "guy", "habit", "blood", etc.
2. **FRESH** - followed by "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
3. **TANK** - followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
4. **TEE** - followed by "shirt", "time", "off", etc.

No obvious connection stands out here as strongly as the previous one.

Let's try one more grouping:

1. **CROP** - followed by "top", "circle", "dusting", etc.
2. **TANK** - again, followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
3. **FRESH** - mentioned earlier, "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
4. **EX** - followed by "girlfriend", "president", "employee", etc.

Here, the words "CROP" and "TANK" both could follow with "top" (crop top, tank top). However, extending this to four words with the same following phrase doesn't work in this selection.

In conclusion, for this set, the strongest pattern match I found involves:

- **CURIOUS**
- **BOY**
- **SAINT**
- **BY**

All of these can logically be followed by the word "George".

— end of example input and output —


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BIG MEAT SUBSTANCE SUE LADY EARLY CORE DEMI THRUST WIRELESS PUSH-UP SPORTS

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **BIG** - deal, bang, apple, time
- **MEAT** - loaf, market, ball, grinder
- **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, control, matter
- **SUE** - storm, me, happy, Grafton
- **LADY** - bird, luck, gaga, liberty
- **EARLY** - bird, riser, adopter, morning
- **CORE** - strength, apple, values, group
- **DEMI** - Moore, god, tasse, Lovato
- **THRUST** - vector, stage, forward, area
- **WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, router
- **PUSH-UP** - bra, challenge, exercise, position
- **SPORTS** - car, center, team, news

### Observations:

Let's look for a common word or phrase that can follow four of these puzzle words.

1. **BIG** - "bang" (big bang)
2. **MEAT** - "ball" (meatball)
3. **SUBSTANCE** - "abuse" (substance abuse)
4. **SUE** - "storm" (Sue Storm, a character from Fantastic Four)
5. **LADY** - "bird" (Lady Bird)
6. **EARLY** - "bird" (early bird)
7. **CORE** - "strength" (core strength)
8. **DEMI** - "Moore" (Demi Moore)
9. **THRUST** - "vector" (thrust vector)
10. **WIRELESS** - "network" (wireless network)
11. **PUSH-UP** - "bra" (push-up bra)
12. **SPORTS** - "car" (sports car)

### Potential Pattern Matches:

- **LADY** and **EARLY** can both be followed by "bird" (Lady Bird, early bird).
- **BIG** and **MEAT** can both be followed by "ball" (big ball, meatball).

Let's see if we can find a group of four:

1. **LADY** - bird
2. **EARLY** - bird
3. **BIG** - ball
4. **MEAT** - ball

Unfortunately, these don't form a group of four with the same following word or phrase.

Let's try another approach:

1. **BIG** - "bang" (big bang)
2. **MEAT** - "market" (meat market)
3. **SUBSTANCE** - "abuse" (substance abuse)
4. **WIRELESS** - "network" (wireless network)

No clear pattern emerges here either.

### Conclusion:

The strongest potential pattern involves:

- **LADY**
- **EARLY**

Both can be followed by "bird", but we need two more words to complete the set. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a group of four words that can all be followed by the same word or phrase from this list. Let's try another pattern or set of words.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are parts of the same thing or process

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BIG THRUST SUBSTANCE MEAT WIRELESS EARLY LADY DEMI SPORTS PUSH-UP CORE SUE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are parts of the same thing or process.

1. **BIG, DEMI, EARLY, LADY**: These words could be related to different types of roles or titles. For example, "BIG" could refer to a "big shot" or "big boss," "DEMI" could refer to "demigod" or "demigoddess," "EARLY" could refer to an "early bird," and "LADY" is a title. However, this connection seems a bit weak and not quite fitting the pattern of being parts of the same thing or process.

2. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**: These words could be related to physical exercise or fitness. "THRUST" and "PUSH-UP" are types of exercises, "CORE" refers to core muscles which are often targeted in workouts, and "SPORTS" is a general category that includes physical activities. This seems like a stronger connection, as they all relate to fitness and exercise.

3. **SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, WIRELESS**: This combination is less clear. "SUBSTANCE" and "MEAT" could be related to food or nutrition, "CORE" could refer to the core of a fruit or the central part of something, and "WIRELESS" seems unrelated to the others.

4. **SUE, LADY, DEMI, EARLY**: These words could be related to names or titles. "SUE" is a name, "LADY" is a title, "DEMI" could refer to a name or title (like Demi Moore), and "EARLY" doesn't fit well here.

Based on these observations, the strongest connection seems to be:

**THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**: These words are all related to physical exercise or fitness. "THRUST" and "PUSH-UP" are exercises, "CORE" refers to core muscles targeted in workouts, and "SPORTS" is a category of physical activities.

This group seems to fit the pattern of being parts of the same thing or process, specifically related to fitness and exercise. Let me know if you think this is a viable solution or if we should explore other possibilities.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT WIRELESS LADY BIG EARLY DEMI THRUST SPORTS SUBSTANCE SUE CORE PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying potential synonymous verbs among the given puzzle words.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words That Can Be Synonymous Verbs

1. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can be verbs related to the action of pushing or exerting force. "Thrust" means to push something suddenly or violently, while "push-up" can refer to the action of pushing oneself up, especially in the context of exercise.

2. **SUE**: This can be a verb meaning to take legal action against someone.

3. **CORE**: This can be a verb meaning to remove the central part of something, like coring an apple.

### Step 2: See If Other Puzzle Words Can Also Be Synonymous Verbs

Let's explore if other words can fit into these categories:

- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: We need two more words that can mean to push or exert force.
  - **SHOVE**: This could be a potential word if it were in the list, but it's not.
  - **DRIVE**: This could work if it were in the list, but it's not.

- **SUE**: We need three more words that can mean to take legal action or something similar.
  - Unfortunately, none of the other words seem to fit this category.

- **CORE**: We need three more words that can mean to remove the central part of something.
  - Again, none of the other words seem to fit this category.

### Conclusion

It seems like we don't have a complete set of four words that can be synonymous verbs based on the current list. Let's try another approach or pattern if possible. If you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern we should consider, let me know!
