system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and the list of words provided:

1. **MEAT, CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**: 
   - This group has a strong connection as they all relate to the concept of the "main part" or "essence" of something. Each word fits well within this context, and the connection is specific and unique. This is a strong candidate for submission.

2. **CORE, PUSH-UP, THRUST, WIRELESS**: 
   - While core exercises, push-ups, and thrusts are related to fitness, the inclusion of "WIRELESS" seems a bit off. Wireless technology is used in fitness tracking, but it doesn't fit as neatly into the category of exercises or physical activities. This connection feels less specific and more forced.

Given the analysis, the strongest viable guess is:

- **MEAT, CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST** - These words all connect to the concept of "ESSENCE" or "MAIN PART." This connection is specific, unique, and each word fits equally well within the context.

Since the other guess involving "WIRELESS" and "PUSH-UP" seems less coherent and forced, and considering that the guess "CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS" was already incorrect, the best course of action is to submit the guess **MEAT, CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**.

Let's submit this guess as it appears to be the strongest and most coherent option from the notes.
