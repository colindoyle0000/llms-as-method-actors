Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are all within the same category

Steps to take:

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle categories are more likely to be the correct connection than simple and ubiquitous categories. Describe the category as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are all within the category of “places in France”: CHAMPAGNE DIJON NICE TOURS
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “black-and-white animals”: ORCA PANDA SKUNK ZEBRA
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “art mediums”: CHARCOAL INK PAINT PASTEL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “basic geometric objects”: LINE POINT RAY SEGMENT
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “avenues in New York City”: BROADWAY FIFTH MADISON PARK
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “cool ’80s slang”: BAD FLY FRESH RAD
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “Disney characters”: DAISY GOOFY HAPPY LADY
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “airline classes”: BUSINESS COACH FIRST PREMIUM
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “notable tv episodes”: FINALE PILOT PREMIERE SPECIAL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “classic halloween costumes”: ANGEL CLOWN PIRATE WITCH
Puzzle words that are all within the category of state abbreviations: HI LA MA OK

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can belong to that same category, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: PAYDAY DOVE SUE DEMI PUSH-UP WIRELESS EARLY MARS MEAT SPORTS THRUST BIG CORE CRUNCH LADY SUBSTANCE

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, as outlined in the instructions.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things.**

1. **PAYDAY and EARLY**: These could both relate to time or events, but it's not a strong connection.
2. **DOVE and LADY**: These could both be names or brands, but again, not a strong connection.
3. **WIRELESS and MARS**: These could relate to technology or space, but it's a stretch.
4. **MEAT and CORE**: These could relate to food or something central, but not a strong connection.
5. **SPORTS and CRUNCH**: These could relate to fitness or exercise.
6. **DEMI and SUE**: These could be names, but not a strong connection.
7. **PUSH-UP and CRUNCH**: These are both exercises.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category.**

Let's explore the category of exercises:

- **PUSH-UP**: A common exercise.
- **CRUNCH**: Another common exercise.
- **THRUST**: This could be related to exercises, like hip thrusts.
- **CORE**: Often associated with exercises targeting the core muscles.

This gives us a potential category of "exercises" with the words PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, THRUST, and CORE.

Let's verify if this category is unique and subtle enough for a New York Times puzzle. Exercises are a common category, but the specific selection of these words might fit the puzzle's requirements.

If this doesn't seem correct, we can try another pattern. Let me know if you want to explore further or if you have any other thoughts!

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words are each a way to do the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each a way to remove hair: SHAVE THREAD TWEEZE WAX
Puzzle words that are each a way to preserve food: CAN CURE DRY FREEZE
Puzzle words that are each a way to get attention: SHOUT SNAP WAVE WHISTLE
Puzzle words that are each a way to say “I give!”: ENOUGH MERCY STOP UNCLE

Puzzle words that are each a way to take a tumble: FALL SLIP SPILL TRIP
Puzzle words that are each a slang way to say “head” using food words: BEAN MELON NOODLE NUT

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SPORTS BIG LADY MARS THRUST PAYDAY SUE CRUNCH DOVE PUSH-UP MEAT WIRELESS SUBSTANCE EARLY DEMI CORE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are each a way to do the same thing. 

1. **Identify potential connections:**
   - **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, DOVE**: These words could be related to physical actions or exercises. "Thrust," "push-up," and "crunch" are all exercises or movements, while "dove" could be interpreted as a diving action.
   - **SPORTS, BIG, LADY, DEMI**: These words could relate to categories or descriptors, but they don't seem to fit a specific action or process.
   - **MARS, EARLY, PAYDAY, WIRELESS**: These words seem more abstract or unrelated to a specific action.
   - **SUE, CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE**: These words could relate to legal actions or core elements, but they don't seem to fit a specific action.

2. **Refine the connections:**
   - Let's focus on the physical actions: **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, DOVE**. These words can be interpreted as movements or exercises:
     - **THRUST**: A forceful push or movement.
     - **PUSH-UP**: An exercise involving pushing the body up.
     - **CRUNCH**: An abdominal exercise.
     - **DOVE**: Past tense of "dive," which is a movement.

3. **Check for consistency:**
   - These words all describe different types of physical movements or exercises, which could be a way to "move the body" or "perform an exercise."

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The group of words **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, DOVE** fits the pattern of being different ways to perform physical movements or exercises.

If this doesn't seem to fit the intended pattern, we can explore other combinations or interpretations. Let me know if you want to try another approach!

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding four words that can be synonymous adjectives. 

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives.**

1. **BIG**: This can be an adjective meaning large in size or importance.
2. **EARLY**: This can be an adjective meaning happening or done before the usual or expected time.

These two words don't seem to be synonymous, so let's try another pair.

1. **CRUNCH**: This can be an adjective in the context of a "crunch situation," meaning critical or decisive.
2. **THRUST**: This can be an adjective in the context of a "thrust area," meaning main or primary.

These two words don't seem to be synonymous either. Let's try another pair.

1. **WIRELESS**: This can be an adjective meaning without wires.
2. **SUBSTANCE**: This doesn't seem to fit as an adjective synonym with any other word here.

Let's try another pair.

1. **LADY**: This can be an adjective in the context of "lady-like," meaning refined or elegant.
2. **DEMI**: This can be an adjective meaning half or partial.

These two words don't seem to be synonymous either. Let's try another pair.

1. **MARS**: This doesn't seem to fit as an adjective synonym with any other word here.
2. **SUE**: This doesn't seem to fit as an adjective synonym with any other word here.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.**

Let's try to find a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives:

1. **BIG**: Large in size or importance.
2. **CORE**: Central or most important part.
3. **MAIN**: Chief or most important.
4. **PRINCIPAL**: First in order of importance.

Unfortunately, "MAIN" and "PRINCIPAL" are not in the list, so let's try another approach.

1. **DEMI**: Half or partial.
2. **LADY**: Refined or elegant.
3. **EARLY**: Before the usual or expected time.
4. **WIRELESS**: Without wires.

These words don't seem to form a coherent group of synonymous adjectives.

**Conclusion:**

I wasn't able to find a group of four words that fit the pattern of synonymous adjectives from the given list. It might be helpful to try another pattern or provide additional context or clues. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern we should consider.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS MARS PAYDAY SUBSTANCE BIG DOVE THRUST CORE SUE EARLY SPORTS PUSH-UP CRUNCH LADY DEMI MEAT

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding synonyms that function as the same part of speech.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms.**

1. **WIRELESS**: This could be an adjective meaning "without wires."
2. **MARS**: This is a proper noun, referring to the planet or the Roman god of war.
3. **PAYDAY**: This is a noun, meaning the day on which someone is paid.
4. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a noun, meaning the physical matter of which a person or thing consists.
5. **BIG**: This is an adjective, meaning large in size.
6. **DOVE**: This is a noun, referring to a type of bird or a person who advocates for peace.
7. **THRUST**: This can be a verb meaning "to push with force" or a noun meaning "a strong push."
8. **CORE**: This is a noun, meaning the central or most important part of something.
9. **SUE**: This is a verb, meaning to bring a legal action against someone.
10. **EARLY**: This is an adjective or adverb, meaning before the usual or expected time.
11. **SPORTS**: This is a noun, referring to physical activities involving skill and competition.
12. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun, referring to a physical exercise.
13. **CRUNCH**: This can be a verb meaning "to crush with the teeth" or a noun meaning "a decisive moment."
14. **LADY**: This is a noun, meaning a woman.
15. **DEMI**: This is an adjective, meaning half or partial.
16. **MEAT**: This is a noun, meaning the flesh of an animal used as food.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.**

Let's start with the word **THRUST** as a verb meaning "to push with force." We can look for other words that can be synonymous with this meaning:

- **THRUST**: Verb meaning "to push with force."
- **PUSH-UP**: While primarily a noun, it involves the action of pushing.
- **CRUNCH**: As a verb, it can mean to exert pressure or force.
- **SUE**: This doesn't fit the pattern of pushing or force.

Let's try another angle:

- **BIG**: Adjective meaning large in size.
- **DEMI**: This doesn't fit as a synonym for "big."
- **EARLY**: This doesn't fit as a synonym for "big."
- **LADY**: This doesn't fit as a synonym for "big."

Let's try another angle:

- **CORE**: Noun meaning the central or most important part.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Noun meaning the physical matter, could be considered the core of something.
- **MEAT**: Noun meaning the flesh of an animal, often considered the core or main part of a meal.
- **THRUST**: As a noun, it can mean the main point or essence, similar to core.

This gives us a potential group of synonyms:

- **CORE**: Noun meaning the central or most important part.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Noun meaning the physical matter or essence.
- **MEAT**: Noun meaning the main part or essence of something.
- **THRUST**: As a noun, it can mean the main point or essence.

This group of words can be synonymous when considering the essence or main part of something. Let me know if this works or if we should try another pattern!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same set of letters

Steps to take: 

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm letters or words that can follow each word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular sets of letters or words rather than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “berry”: BLUE GOOSE RASP STRAW
Puzzle words that are each followed by “land countries”: ICE IRE FIN NETHER
Puzzle words that are each followed by “-o”: DADDY DAY JACKIE JELL

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same set of letters or words that can follow them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular sets of letters or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words. 

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have that same set of letters or word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same set of letters or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.
