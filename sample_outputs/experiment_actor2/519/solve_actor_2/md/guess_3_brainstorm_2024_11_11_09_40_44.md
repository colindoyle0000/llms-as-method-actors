Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each a kind of a thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. Describe the connection between the puzzle words as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each a kind of organization: CLUB GROUP PARTY TEAM
Puzzle words that are each a kind of shirt: CROP POLO TANK TEE
Puzzle words that are each a kind of bird: CARDINAL JAY LARK SWIFT
Puzzle words that are each a kind of transportation: BOAT CAR PLANE TRAIN
Puzzle words that are each a kind of cartoon mouse: ITCHY JERRY PINKY SPEEDY
Puzzle words that are each a kind of accessory: BELT BRACELET TIE WATCH
Puzzle words that are each a kind of container: BASKET BIN CHEST HAMPER
Puzzle words that are each a kind of circular shape: BAND CIRCLE HOOP RING
Puzzle words that are each a kind of place to shop: MALL MARKET OUTLET STORE
Puzzle words that are each a kind of wrench: ALLEN CRESCENT MONKEY SOCKET

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by being a kind of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

2. **DOVE**: This is a type of bird.
3. **MEAT**: This could refer to a type of food.
4. **CRUNCH**: This could refer to a type of exercise or a type of sound.
5. **EARLY**: This could refer to a time or a type of period.
6. **SPORTS**: This could refer to a type of activity or category.
7. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.
8. **THRUST**: This could refer to a type of movement or force.

14. **SUE**: This could refer to a type of legal action.
15. **MARS**: This is a type of planet.
16. **PAYDAY**: This could refer to a type of event or day.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**: These could all be types of exercises or movements related to fitness.
- **LADY, DEMI, BIG, EARLY**: These could all be types of sizes or descriptors (e.g., lady size, demi size, big size, early period).
- **WIRELESS, SPORTS, MARS, PAYDAY**: These could be types of categories or themes (e.g., wireless technology, sports category, Mars theme, payday event).

Let's focus on the first group:

- **CRUNCH**: A type of exercise.
- **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise.
- **THRUST**: A type of movement, often used in exercise contexts.
- **CORE**: Often refers to exercises targeting the core muscles.

This group seems to fit the pattern of being types of exercises or movements related to fitness. Let's go with this as a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can explore other connections.

14. **DEMI**: This is typically an adjective meaning half, but as a noun, it could refer to a small amount or a person with that name.
15. **WIRELESS**: This is typically an adjective, but as a noun, it could refer to a wireless device or technology.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.**

Let's focus on words that can be synonymous nouns:

- **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can refer to the essential part of something.
- **THRUST**: Can also mean the main point or essence of an argument, similar to core and substance.
- **MEAT**: Can mean the main part or essence of something, similar to core, substance, and thrust.

**Possible Solution:**

- **CORE**
- **SUBSTANCE**
- **THRUST**

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE PAYDAY DOVE DEMI THRUST EARLY BIG LADY WIRELESS SUE SPORTS CRUNCH CORE PUSH-UP MEAT MARS

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We need to find a group of four words from the list that can substitute for each other, functioning as the same part of speech. Let's start by identifying potential connections between pairs of words.

1. **SUBSTANCE and MEAT**: Both can be nouns referring to the essential part or core of something. "Substance" can mean the essential nature or most important part of something, while "meat" can be used metaphorically to mean the core or most substantial part of a discussion or argument.

2. **PAYDAY and PAY**: "Payday" is a noun referring to the day on which someone receives their salary, while "pay" can be a verb meaning to give money in exchange for work or services. However, "pay" is not in the list, so this connection doesn't help us.

3. **DOVE and LADY**: Both can be nouns referring to a gentle or peaceful person. "Dove" is often used metaphorically to describe someone who advocates for peace, while "lady" can refer to a woman who is gentle or refined.

4. **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: Both can be verbs related to pushing or exerting force. "Thrust" means to push something suddenly or violently in a specified direction, while "push-up" is a noun referring to an exercise, but it can also imply the action of pushing oneself up.

5. **EARLY and BIG**: Both can be adjectives, but they don't share a specific meaning that allows them to substitute for each other.

6. **WIRELESS and SPORTS**: Both can be nouns, but they don't share a specific meaning that allows them to substitute for each other.

7. **CRUNCH and CRUNCH TIME**: "Crunch" can be a noun meaning a critical moment or situation, similar to "crunch time," which is not in the list but is a related concept.

8. **CORE and MEAT**: Both can be nouns referring to the central or most important part of something.

9. **MARS and EARLY**: Both can be nouns, but they don't share a specific meaning that allows them to substitute for each other.

Based on these observations, let's focus on the words that have potential connections:

- **SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE**: These three words can all refer to the essential or central part of something. We need one more word to complete the group.

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP**: These two words relate to pushing or exerting force. We need two more words to complete the group.

Let's see if we can find a fourth word for the first group:

- **CRUNCH**: This can also refer to a critical or essential moment, similar to "core" or "substance" in a metaphorical sense.

So, we have a potential group: **SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, CRUNCH**. These words can all function as nouns referring to the essential or central part of something.

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or explore other connections. Let me know if you want to explore further or if you have any other ideas!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CORE DOVE CRUNCH SPORTS PUSH-UP PAYDAY SUE LADY DEMI SUBSTANCE WIRELESS MEAT BIG THRUST MARS EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, following the pattern of finding words that connect to different meanings of the same word or letter.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **CORE**: 
   - Core can refer to the central part of something (like an apple core).
   - It can also refer to a group of people who are central to an organization or activity (like the core team).

2. **CRUNCH**:
   - Crunch can refer to a sound made when something is crushed or chewed.
   - It can also refer to a critical situation or a shortage (like a credit crunch).

### Step 2: Find Other Words

Let's see if we can find other words that connect to different meanings of the same word or letter.

3. **THRUST**:
   - Thrust can refer to a forceful push or shove.
   - It can also refer to the main point or essence of an argument or discussion.

4. **PUSH-UP**:
   - Push-up can refer to a physical exercise.
   - It can also refer to a type of bra that enhances cleavage.

### Group of Four Words

Now, let's see if these words can connect to different meanings of the same word:

- **CORE**: Central part or group.
- **CRUNCH**: Sound or critical situation.
- **THRUST**: Forceful push or main point.
- **PUSH-UP**: Exercise or type of bra.

These words don't seem to connect to different meanings of the same word. Let's try another approach.

### Another Attempt

1. **WIRELESS**:
   - Wireless can refer to technology that doesn't use wires (like Wi-Fi).
   - It can also refer to an old-fashioned term for a radio.

2. **PAYDAY**:
   - Payday can refer to the day when one receives their salary.
   - It can also refer to a big reward or windfall.

3. **SUBSTANCE**:
   - Substance can refer to a particular kind of matter with uniform properties.
   - It can also refer to the essence or most important part of something.

4. **MEAT**:
   - Meat can refer to the flesh of an animal used as food.
   - It can also refer to the main part of something (like the meat of an argument).

### Group of Four Words

- **WIRELESS**: Technology or radio.
- **PAYDAY**: Salary day or windfall.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Matter or essence.
- **MEAT**: Flesh or main part.

These words still don't seem to connect to different meanings of the same word. Let's try another approach.

### Final Attempt

1. **BIG**:
   - Big can refer to size.
   - It can also refer to importance or significance.

2. **LADY**:
   - Lady can refer to a woman.
   - It can also refer to a title of nobility.

3. **DEMI**:
   - Demi can refer to half (as in demigod).
   - It can also refer to a small amount or partial (as in demitasse).

4. **MARS**:
   - Mars can refer to the planet.
   - It can also refer to the Roman god of war.

### Group of Four Words

- **BIG**: Size or importance.
- **LADY**: Woman or title.
- **DEMI**: Half or small amount.
- **MARS**: Planet or god.

These words still don't seem to connect to different meanings of the same word. Let's try another approach.

### Conclusion

It seems we are struggling to find a group of four words that connect to different meanings of the same word. We might need to try another pattern or get more context on the puzzle. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if we should try a different approach.

For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can follow each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words and phrases rather than generic and ubiquitous words and phrases.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “George”: BOY BY CURIOUS SAINT
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Valley”: DEATH HIDDEN SILICON UNCANNY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Crane”: CONSTRUCTION FRASIER PAPER WHOOPING
Puzzle words that are each followed by “up”: AMP FIRE HYPE PUMP
Puzzle words that are each followed by “jam”: NBA PAPER PEARL TRAFFIC
Puzzle words that are each followed by “bear”: BOO-BOO BROWN HONEY TEDDY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “chip”: BLUE COMPUTER POKER POTATO
Puzzle words that are each followed by “wheel”: CHEESE COLOR HAMSTER PRAYER

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same word or phrase that follows them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words and phrases are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same word or phrase. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CROP CURIOUS BAD TANK GEE FLY BEE FRESH TEE RAD EX JAY BOY POLO BY SAINT

Output:

To tackle this puzzle effectively, let's begin by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **CROP** - dust, circles, top, rotation
- **CURIOUS** - George, case, about, nature
- **BAD** - news, influence, boy, habit
- **TANK** - top, engine, battle, fish
- **GEE** - whiz, thanks, golly, willikers
- **FLY** - swatter, fishing, high, away
- **BEE** - hive, line, pollen, movie
- **FRESH** - air, produce, start, prince
- **TEE** - shirt, time, off, ball
- **RAD** - tech, radiation, cool, level
- **EX** - wife, husband, file, change
- **JAY** - bird, walk, Z, blue
- **BOY** - scout, friend, George, band
- **POLO** - shirt, match, water, club
- **BY** - pass, law, product, George
- **SAINT** - Bernard, Mary, George, Nicholas

### Observations:

Observing a connection here with the word "George", as it follows CURIOUS (from the character Curious George), BOY (from the character Boy George), SAINT (Saint George), and BY (like in a phrase, although a bit of a stretch). Here's a pattern match:

**Pattern:** Words that are each followed by “George”

- CURIOUS
- BOY
- SAINT
- BY

Now, let's test another set of puzzle words:

1. **BAD** - followed by "guy", "habit", "blood", etc.
2. **FRESH** - followed by "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
3. **TANK** - followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
4. **TEE** - followed by "shirt", "time", "off", etc.

No obvious connection stands out here as strongly as the previous one.

Let's try one more grouping:

1. **CROP** - followed by "top", "circle", "dusting", etc.
2. **TANK** - again, followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
3. **FRESH** - mentioned earlier, "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
4. **EX** - followed by "girlfriend", "president", "employee", etc.

Here, the words "CROP" and "TANK" both could follow with "top" (crop top, tank top). However, extending this to four words with the same following phrase doesn't work in this selection.

In conclusion, for this set, the strongest pattern match I found involves:

- **CURIOUS**
- **BOY**
- **SAINT**
- **BY**

All of these can logically be followed by the word "George".

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BIG MEAT LADY SUE DOVE MARS SPORTS WIRELESS CORE THRUST CRUNCH DEMI PUSH-UP PAYDAY EARLY SUBSTANCE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **BIG** - deal, bang, time, apple
- **MEAT** - market, loaf, ball, grinder
- **LADY** - bug, bird, luck, gaga
- **SUE** - storm, me, grafton, ellen
- **DOVE** - bar, soap, chocolate, peace

- **PAYDAY** - loan, bar, friday, advance
- **EARLY** - bird, riser, morning, adopter
- **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, control, matter

### Observations:

Let's look for a common word or phrase that can follow four of these puzzle words.

1. **MEAT**, **MARS**, **CRUNCH**, **PAYDAY** - All can be followed by "bar":
   - MEAT bar
   - MARS bar
   - CRUNCH bar
   - PAYDAY bar

This seems to be a strong pattern match. Let's verify:

- **MEAT** - meat bar (a type of protein bar)
- **MARS** - Mars bar (a popular chocolate bar)
- **CRUNCH** - Crunch bar (a type of chocolate bar)
- **PAYDAY** - Payday bar (a type of candy bar)

### Conclusion:

The strongest pattern match I found involves:

- **MEAT**
- **MARS**
- **CRUNCH**
- **PAYDAY**

All of these can logically be followed by the word "bar". This seems to be a valid solution to the puzzle. If you need further assistance or another pattern, let me know!
