Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each come after the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can come before each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each come after “SECRET”: AGENT CODE SANTA SAUCE
Puzzle words that each come after “FUNNY”: BONE BUSINESS GIRL PAGES
Puzzle words that each come after “SILVER”: FOX LINING SCREEN SPOON
Puzzle words that each come after “STICKY”: FINGERS NOTE RICE WICKET
Puzzle words that each come after “SECOND”: FIDDLE GUESS NATURE WIND
Puzzle words that each come after “PLAY”: DATE DEAD DIRTY DOH
Puzzle words that each come after “CAT’S” : CRADLE EYE MEOW PAJAMAS
Puzzle words that each come after “SPACE”: BAR CADET HEATER STATION
Puzzle words that each come after “LIVING”: LARGE LEGEND PROOF ROOM
Puzzle words that each come after “HEAD OF”: HAIR LETTUCE STATE STEAM

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can have the same word come before them.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same word come before them, trying to arrive at a group of four words that can each have the same word come before them. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BABY SEGMENT DEAR SANTA LINE FIRE POINT BOO RAY JUICE ENERGY AGENT ZIP LOVE CODE SAUCE

Output:

Let’s examine the list of puzzle words provided to see what words come before these words, then identify puzzle words from the list that have the same words that commonly come before them, then identify what other puzzle words could form this connection, then arrive at a conclusion.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**BABY** - newborn, my, little, sweet

**SEGMENT** - market, audience

**DEAR** - my, oh

**SANTA** - dear, secret

**LINE** - front, base, guide, head, through

**FIRE** - forest, camp, house, bon

**POINT** - focal, starting, main, critical

**BOO** - peek-a-, boo-

**RAY** - x-, sun, gamma, manta

**JUICE** - orange, apple, fruit, grape

**ENERGY** - renewable, solar, kinetic, nuclear

**AGENT** - special, real estate, secret, travel

**ZIP** - 

**LOVE** - true, self, romantic, unconditional

**CODE** - zip, area, bar, dress

**SAUCE** - hot, tomato, soy, barbecue

**Step 2: Puzzle words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Secret - SANTA, AGENT

**Step 3: What other puzzle word could have secret come before them?**

Secret BABY? No

Secret SEGMENT? No

Secret DEAR? No

Secret LINE? No

Secret FIRE? No

Secret POINT? No

Secret BOO? Unlikely

Secret RAY? No

Secret JUICE? No

Secret ENERGY? Unlikely

Secret ZIP? No

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST PUSH-UP DEMI SUBSTANCE CORE MEAT SPORTS WIRELESS

## Output

Let's go through the steps to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match the pattern: puzzle words that each come after the same word or phrase.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**THRUST** - rocket, power, engine, main

**PUSH-UP** - exercise, bra, challenge

**DEMI** - semi, half, moore, lovato

**SUBSTANCE** - controlled, chemical, abuse, physical

**CORE** - apple, nuclear, hard, inner

**MEAT** - red, white, ground, processed

**SPORTS** - team, extreme, water, motor

**WIRELESS** - bluetooth, radio, network, internet

**Step 2: Puzzle words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Let's identify any common words or phrases that could precede multiple puzzle words:

- **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can follow "nuclear" (nuclear core, nuclear substance).
- **SPORTS** and **WIRELESS**: Both can follow "network" (sports network, wireless network).
- **THRUST** and **CORE**: Both can follow "engine" (thrust engine, core engine).

**Step 3: What other puzzle words could have the same word come before them?**

Let's explore these possibilities further:

- **Nuclear**: CORE, SUBSTANCE
  - Nuclear THRUST? Unlikely
  - Nuclear PUSH-UP? No
  - Nuclear DEMI? No
  - Nuclear MEAT? No
  - Nuclear SPORTS? No
  - Nuclear WIRELESS? No

- **Network**: SPORTS, WIRELESS
  - Network THRUST? No
  - Network PUSH-UP? No
  - Network DEMI? No
  - Network CORE? No
  - Network MEAT? No
  - Network SUBSTANCE? No

- **Engine**: THRUST, CORE
  - Engine PUSH-UP? No
  - Engine DEMI? No
  - Engine SUBSTANCE? No
  - Engine MEAT? No
  - Engine SPORTS? No
  - Engine WIRELESS? No

**Step 4: Conclusion**

It seems challenging to find a group of four words that can each have the same word come before them from this list. We might need to consider other potential words or phrases that could precede these puzzle words or try a different pattern. If you have any other ideas or if we should try another pattern, let me know!

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each share the same unique characteristic. For this pattern, the connection is with how the puzzle words are structured or how the words sound, not with what the words mean.

Steps to take:

Step 1: Say different puzzle words aloud and try to identify two puzzle words that share a unique characteristic related to how the word is structured or sounds. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular characteristics are more likely to be the correct connection than generic and ubiquitous characteristics. Think outside the box.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each heteronyms: BASS DOVE DESERT WIND
Puzzle words that are each letter spellings: BEE EX GEE JAY
Puzzle words that are each two letters + number: CANINE FREIGHT OFTEN STONE
Puzzle words that are each examples of onomatopoeia: BANG PLOP SPLASH THUD
Puzzle words that are each ”-ough” words that don’t rhyme: BOUGH COUGH DOUGH TOUGH
Puzzle words that are each words you say twice in a row: BOO POM TOM YO
Puzzle words that are each palindromes: BIB EYE GAG POP

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can have that same characteristic. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Try saying each puzzle word aloud to hear if the linguistic characteristic is present. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four words, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT SPORTS DEMI THRUST CORE SUBSTANCE WIRELESS PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's go through the list of puzzle words and see if we can identify a unique characteristic that four of them share. We'll start by saying each word aloud and considering their structure or sound.

1. **MEAT**
2. **SPORTS**
3. **DEMI**
4. **THRUST**
5. **CORE**
6. **SUBSTANCE**
7. **WIRELESS**
8. **PUSH-UP**

Let's consider some potential characteristics:

- **Syllable Count**: Check if any words share the same number of syllables.
- **Phonetic Patterns**: Look for rhymes, alliteration, or similar sounds.
- **Word Structure**: Consider prefixes, suffixes, or compound words.
- **Letter Patterns**: Look for words with the same starting or ending letters.

### Step 1: Initial Observations

- **Compound Words**: "SPORTS" and "PUSH-UP" are compound words. Let's see if there are more.
- **Hyphenated Words**: "PUSH-UP" is hyphenated. Check for others.
- **Prefixes/Suffixes**: "WIRELESS" has a suffix "-less". Check for others.
- **Syllable Count**: Let's count syllables:
  - MEAT (1)
  - SPORTS (1)
  - DEMI (2)
  - THRUST (1)
  - CORE (1)
  - SUBSTANCE (2)
  - WIRELESS (2)
  - PUSH-UP (2)

### Step 2: Explore Patterns

- **Compound Words**: "SPORTS" and "PUSH-UP" are compound words. Let's see if "WIRELESS" and "SUBSTANCE" can fit this pattern.
  - "WIRELESS" is a compound word (WIRE + LESS).
  - "SUBSTANCE" is not a compound word.

- **Hyphenated Words**: Only "PUSH-UP" is hyphenated.

- **Words with Suffixes**: "WIRELESS" has a suffix "-less". Check for others.
  - None of the other words have a similar suffix.

- **Syllable Count**: Words with two syllables: "DEMI", "SUBSTANCE", "WIRELESS", "PUSH-UP".

### Step 3: Form a Group

Based on the syllable count, let's consider the two-syllable words:

- **DEMI**
- **SUBSTANCE**
- **WIRELESS**
- **PUSH-UP**

These words all have two syllables. Let's see if this pattern holds:

- **DEMI**: 2 syllables
- **SUBSTANCE**: 2 syllables
- **WIRELESS**: 2 syllables
- **PUSH-UP**: 2 syllables

This is a potential group based on syllable count. Let's propose this as a possible solution and see if it fits the pattern the puzzle requires. If not, we can explore other characteristics.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are all within the same category

Steps to take:

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle categories are more likely to be the correct connection than simple and ubiquitous categories. Describe the category as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are all within the category of “places in France”: CHAMPAGNE DIJON NICE TOURS
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “black-and-white animals”: ORCA PANDA SKUNK ZEBRA
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “art mediums”: CHARCOAL INK PAINT PASTEL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “basic geometric objects”: LINE POINT RAY SEGMENT
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “avenues in New York City”: BROADWAY FIFTH MADISON PARK
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “cool ’80s slang”: BAD FLY FRESH RAD
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “Disney characters”: DAISY GOOFY HAPPY LADY
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “airline classes”: BUSINESS COACH FIRST PREMIUM
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “notable tv episodes”: FINALE PILOT PREMIERE SPECIAL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “classic halloween costumes”: ANGEL CLOWN PIRATE WITCH
Puzzle words that are all within the category of state abbreviations: HI LA MA OK

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can belong to that same category, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 The following guesses were incorrect: 
CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CORE SUBSTANCE WIRELESS MEAT THRUST PUSH-UP SPORTS DEMI

## Output

Let's start by examining the list of puzzle words: CORE, SUBSTANCE, WIRELESS, MEAT, THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, DEMI.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category.

1. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: These could both relate to something fundamental or essential, but it's a bit broad.
2. **WIRELESS and SPORTS**: These don't seem to fit together in a specific category.
3. **MEAT and CORE**: These don't seem to fit together in a specific category.
4. **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: These could both relate to physical actions or exercises.
5. **DEMI and SUBSTANCE**: These don't seem to fit together in a specific category.

Let's focus on **THRUST and PUSH-UP** as they both relate to physical actions or exercises.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category.

- **CORE**: This could also relate to physical exercises, as "core" exercises are common in fitness.
- **SPORTS**: This fits well within the category of physical activities or exercises.

So, we have a potential category: "Physical exercises or activities."

Possible group of four puzzle words: **CORE, THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS**

Let's consider if this category is unique or subtle enough for a New York Times puzzle. It might be a bit broad, but it's worth considering.

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or category. Let me know if you want to explore other possibilities!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: PUSH-UP WIRELESS SPORTS CORE SUBSTANCE THRUST DEMI MEAT

## Output

Let's break down the puzzle words and see if we can identify any patterns or connections between them. We need to find four words that are each a way to do the same thing.

1. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise, specifically a bodyweight exercise that targets the upper body.
2. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without physical connections, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
3. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games, often competitive, that involve skill and physical exertion.
4. **CORE**: This can refer to the central part of something, or in fitness, exercises that target the core muscles.
5. **SUBSTANCE**: This refers to a particular kind of matter with uniform properties.
6. **THRUST**: This means to push or drive with force.
7. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half or partial.
8. **MEAT**: This refers to the flesh of an animal used as food.

Let's try to identify two words that are each a way to do the same thing:

- **PUSH-UP** and **CORE**: Both relate to exercises, specifically targeting the body. A push-up is a type of exercise, and core exercises target the core muscles.
- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both involve a pushing motion or force.

Now, let's see if we can find other words that fit with these:

- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP** both involve a pushing action. 
- **WIRELESS** and **CORE** don't seem to fit with the pushing action.
- **SPORTS** could involve pushing in some contexts, but it's too broad.
- **SUBSTANCE**, **DEMI**, and **MEAT** don't seem to fit with the pushing action.

Let's try another angle:

- **CORE** and **PUSH-UP** both relate to fitness and exercises.
- **SPORTS** could fit with fitness and exercises.
- **THRUST** doesn't fit with fitness directly, but it involves physical exertion.

Possible group related to fitness/exercise:
- **PUSH-UP**
- **CORE**
- **SPORTS**

We need one more word that fits with fitness/exercise:

- **THRUST** could fit if we consider it as a physical action, but it's not specific to fitness.
- **WIRELESS**, **SUBSTANCE**, **DEMI**, and **MEAT** don't fit with fitness/exercise.

It seems we're struggling to find a fourth word that fits the pattern of fitness/exercise. Let's try another pattern or see if there's another angle we haven't considered. If you have any other ideas or want to try a different approach, let me know!

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous adjectives.

Examples from prior puzzles:

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT THRUST CORE DEMI WIRELESS PUSH-UP SPORTS SUBSTANCE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives.

1. **CORE**: As an adjective, "core" can mean central or essential.
2. **SUBSTANCE**: As an adjective, "substantial" can mean essential or fundamental.

These two words can be synonymous in the sense of being central or essential.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words identified.

3. **MEAT**: As an adjective, "meaty" can mean substantial or significant, which aligns with "core" and "substance" in terms of being essential or fundamental.
4. **THRUST**: As an adjective, "thrust" doesn't directly fit, but if we consider "thrust" in terms of its core meaning, it can imply a central or main point, which can be seen as essential.

Let's see if we can find a better fit for the fourth word:

- **DEMI**: As an adjective, "demi" means half or partial, which doesn't fit with the theme of essential or central.
- **WIRELESS**: As an adjective, "wireless" doesn't fit the theme of essential or central.
- **PUSH-UP**: As an adjective, "push-up" doesn't fit the theme of essential or central.
- **SPORTS**: As an adjective, "sporty" doesn't fit the theme of essential or central.

It seems like we have a potential group with "CORE," "SUBSTANCE," and "MEAT," but we need a fourth word that fits the theme of being essential or central. Let's try another approach:

- **THRUST**: If we consider "thrust" as the main point or essence, it could fit with "core," "substance," and "meat."

So, a possible group of four words could be: CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST.

If this doesn't work, we might need to explore other patterns or combinations. Let me know if you want to try another approach or if there's anything else I can do to help!
