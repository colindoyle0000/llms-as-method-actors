Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each share the same unique characteristic. For this pattern, the connection is with how the puzzle words are structured or how the words sound, not with what the words mean.

Steps to take:

Step 1: Say different puzzle words aloud and try to identify two puzzle words that share a unique characteristic related to how the word is structured or sounds. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular characteristics are more likely to be the correct connection than generic and ubiquitous characteristics. Think outside the box.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each heteronyms: BASS DOVE DESERT WIND
Puzzle words that are each letter spellings: BEE EX GEE JAY
Puzzle words that are each two letters + number: CANINE FREIGHT OFTEN STONE
Puzzle words that are each examples of onomatopoeia: BANG PLOP SPLASH THUD
Puzzle words that are each ”-ough” words that don’t rhyme: BOUGH COUGH DOUGH TOUGH
Puzzle words that are each words you say twice in a row: BOO POM TOM YO
Puzzle words that are each palindromes: BIB EYE GAG POP

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can have that same characteristic. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Try saying each puzzle word aloud to hear if the linguistic characteristic is present. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four words, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 The following guesses were incorrect: 
CORE DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS


Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE THRUST MEAT CORE DEMI SPORTS WIRELESS

## Output

Let's go through the list of puzzle words and see if we can identify a unique characteristic that connects four of them. We'll consider how the words are structured or how they sound, rather than their meanings.

1. **PUSH-UP**
2. **SUBSTANCE**
3. **THRUST**
4. **MEAT**
5. **CORE**
6. **DEMI**
7. **SPORTS**
8. **WIRELESS**

Let's try saying them aloud and see if any patterns emerge:

- **PUSH-UP**: This is a compound word with a hyphen.
- **SUBSTANCE**: This is a straightforward noun.
- **THRUST**: This is a verb or noun, depending on context.
- **MEAT**: This is a straightforward noun.
- **CORE**: This is a straightforward noun.
- **DEMI**: This is a prefix or a standalone word meaning "half."
- **SPORTS**: This is a straightforward noun.
- **WIRELESS**: This is a compound word without a hyphen.

Let's consider some potential patterns:

1. **Compound Words**: PUSH-UP and WIRELESS are compound words. We need two more to fit this pattern, but none of the others seem to fit.

2. **Words with Silent Letters**: None of these words seem to have silent letters.

3. **Words with Double Letters**: None of these words have double letters.

4. **Words with Prefixes or Suffixes**: DEMI is a prefix, and WIRELESS has a suffix (-less). However, we need two more words to fit this pattern.

5. **Words with a Specific Number of Syllables**: Let's count the syllables:
   - PUSH-UP: 2 syllables
   - SUBSTANCE: 2 syllables
   - THRUST: 1 syllable
   - MEAT: 1 syllable
   - CORE: 1 syllable
   - DEMI: 2 syllables
   - SPORTS: 1 syllable
   - WIRELESS: 2 syllables

   We have four words with 2 syllables: PUSH-UP, SUBSTANCE, DEMI, and WIRELESS. This could be a potential pattern.

Let's propose this as a possible solution: **PUSH-UP, SUBSTANCE, DEMI, WIRELESS** (all have 2 syllables).

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern. Let me know if you want to explore further!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are all within the same category

Steps to take:

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle categories are more likely to be the correct connection than simple and ubiquitous categories. Describe the category as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are all within the category of “places in France”: CHAMPAGNE DIJON NICE TOURS
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “black-and-white animals”: ORCA PANDA SKUNK ZEBRA
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “art mediums”: CHARCOAL INK PAINT PASTEL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “basic geometric objects”: LINE POINT RAY SEGMENT
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “avenues in New York City”: BROADWAY FIFTH MADISON PARK
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “cool ’80s slang”: BAD FLY FRESH RAD
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “Disney characters”: DAISY GOOFY HAPPY LADY
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “airline classes”: BUSINESS COACH FIRST PREMIUM
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “notable tv episodes”: FINALE PILOT PREMIERE SPECIAL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “classic halloween costumes”: ANGEL CLOWN PIRATE WITCH
Puzzle words that are all within the category of state abbreviations: HI LA MA OK

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can belong to that same category, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SPORTS THRUST PUSH-UP MEAT CORE SUBSTANCE WIRELESS DEMI

## Output

Let's start by examining the list of puzzle words: SPORTS, THRUST, PUSH-UP, MEAT, CORE, SUBSTANCE, WIRELESS, DEMI.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category.

1. **SPORTS and PUSH-UP**: These could both relate to physical activities or exercises.
2. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: These could both relate to something fundamental or essential.
3. **WIRELESS and DEMI**: These don't seem to fit together in an obvious category.

Let's explore the first option further:

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category.

- **SPORTS**: This is a broad category that includes various physical activities.
- **PUSH-UP**: This is a specific exercise, which fits under the category of physical activities or exercises.
- **THRUST**: This could relate to a movement or action, possibly fitting into a category of physical actions or dynamics.
- **CORE**: In fitness, this refers to exercises targeting the core muscles, which could fit into the category of exercises.

So, one possible category could be "types of physical activities or exercises":

1. SPORTS
2. PUSH-UP
3. THRUST
4. CORE

This combination seems to fit the pattern of being within the same category related to physical activities or exercises. Let's consider this as a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can explore other categories or combinations.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words are each a way to do the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each a way to remove hair: SHAVE THREAD TWEEZE WAX
Puzzle words that are each a way to preserve food: CAN CURE DRY FREEZE
Puzzle words that are each a way to get attention: SHOUT SNAP WAVE WHISTLE
Puzzle words that are each a way to say “I give!”: ENOUGH MERCY STOP UNCLE
Puzzle words that are each a way to say “Step on it!": FASTER GO HURRY MOVE
Puzzle words that are each a way to preserve a meat: CANS CURES SALTS SMOKES
Puzzle words that are each a way to say “My mistake!”: APOLOGIES OOPS PARDON SORRY
Puzzle words that are each a way to say a win is assured: CLINCH GUARANTEE LOCK SECURE
Puzzle words that are each a way to take a tumble: FALL SLIP SPILL TRIP
Puzzle words that are each a slang way to say “head” using food words: BEAN MELON NOODLE NUT

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CORE SPORTS WIRELESS SUBSTANCE THRUST MEAT PUSH-UP DEMI

## Output

Let's start by examining the list of puzzle words: CORE, SPORTS, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT, PUSH-UP, DEMI.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing.

1. **CORE and THRUST**: Both could be related to physical exercise or strength training. "Core" exercises target the core muscles, and "thrust" could refer to exercises like hip thrusts.
2. **WIRELESS and SUBSTANCE**: These don't seem to have an obvious connection in terms of doing the same thing.
3. **MEAT and SUBSTANCE**: Both could be related to food or nutrition, as meat is a type of substance.
4. **PUSH-UP and THRUST**: Both are exercises, specifically strength training exercises.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words are also a way to do that same thing.

Let's explore the exercise/strength training angle:

- **CORE**: Refers to exercises targeting the core muscles.
- **THRUST**: Could refer to exercises like hip thrusts.
- **PUSH-UP**: A common bodyweight exercise.
- **SPORTS**: While not an exercise per se, sports often involve physical activity and exercise.

This gives us a potential group: CORE, THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS. However, this was already guessed and found incorrect.

Let's try another angle:

- **CORE**: Could also refer to the central part of something.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Could refer to the essence or core of something.
- **MEAT**: Often used metaphorically to mean the core or main part of something.
- **THRUST**: Could metaphorically mean the main point or core idea.

This gives us another potential group: CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST. These words can all metaphorically refer to the central or main part of something.

Let's submit this group and see if it fits the pattern. If not, we can try another approach.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE MEAT SPORTS WIRELESS THRUST CORE DEMI PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives.

1. **SUBSTANCE**: As an adjective, "substantial" could mean something like "significant" or "important."
2. **MEAT**: As an adjective, "meaty" could mean "substantial" or "significant" in terms of content or importance.

These two words can be synonymous adjectives meaning "substantial" or "significant."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.

3. **CORE**: As an adjective, "core" can mean "central" or "essential," which aligns with "substantial" or "significant."
4. **THRUST**: As an adjective, "thrust" doesn't directly fit, but if we consider "thrust" in terms of "main thrust" or "primary focus," it could align with "central" or "significant."

Let's see if we can find a better fit for the fourth word:

- **WIRELESS**: As an adjective, it doesn't fit the pattern of "substantial" or "significant."
- **DEMI**: As an adjective, it means "half" or "partial," which doesn't fit.
- **PUSH-UP**: As an adjective, it doesn't fit the pattern.

Given the options, the best fit for a group of four synonymous adjectives might be:

- **SUBSTANCE** (substantial)
- **MEAT** (meaty)
- **CORE** (central, essential)
- **THRUST** (main thrust, primary focus)

This group aligns with the idea of being "substantial" or "significant." If this doesn't work, we may need to consider a different pattern or set of synonyms. Let me know if you want to explore another angle or if there's another pattern to consider.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS SUBSTANCE MEAT CORE THRUST SPORTS DEMI PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step. We need to find four words from the list that can be synonymous with each other, functioning as the same part of speech. 

1. **Identify potential synonyms:**

   - **CORE**: This can mean the central or most important part of something. 
   - **THRUST**: As a noun, it can mean the main point or essence of something.
   - **MEAT**: Informally, this can refer to the essential part or substance of something.
   - **SUBSTANCE**: This can mean the essential nature or most important part of something.

2. **Check if they function as the same part of speech:**

   - All four words can function as nouns, referring to the essential or central part of something.

3. **Verify the synonymy:**

   - **CORE**, **THRUST**, **MEAT**, and **SUBSTANCE** can all be used to describe the essential or central part of something, making them synonymous in this context.

Therefore, a possible solution to the puzzle is: **CORE, THRUST, MEAT, SUBSTANCE**. 

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or set of words. Let me know if you need further assistance!
