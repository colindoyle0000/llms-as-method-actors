You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential guesses and the list of words provided to determine if there's a strong guess to submit.

### Analysis of Potential Guesses:

1. **WIRELESS, THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE**:
   - "Wireless" seems out of place compared to the others, which are more directly related to physical exercises.

2. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**:
   - "Thrust" and "Push-up" are specific exercises.
   - "Sports" is a broader category that encompasses physical activities.
   - "Core" relates to exercises targeting the core muscles.

### Evaluation of the Words Provided:

- **CORE**: Can relate to exercises or the central part of something.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Could relate to material or essence.
- **DEMI**: Often used as a prefix meaning "half" or "partial."
- **WIRELESS**: Relates to technology or communication without wires.
- **MEAT**: Refers to animal flesh used as food.
- **EARLY**: Relates to time, meaning before the usual or expected time.
- **SPORTS**: Relates to physical activities or games.
- **THRUST**: Can be a movement or forceful push, often used in exercises.
- **LADY**: Refers to a woman.
- **PUSH-UP**: A specific exercise.
- **SUE**: Can mean to take legal action.
- **BIG**: Refers to size, meaning large.

### Conclusion:

The second guess (**THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**) seems to be the strongest viable guess because all four words are more directly related to physical activities or exercises, and they fit well together in terms of specificity and context. The connection is clear and specific, which aligns with the guidelines for a strong guess.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess: **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**. This guess seems to have the strongest connection among the words provided. If this guess is incorrect, we can then go back to brainstorming other possible connections./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
