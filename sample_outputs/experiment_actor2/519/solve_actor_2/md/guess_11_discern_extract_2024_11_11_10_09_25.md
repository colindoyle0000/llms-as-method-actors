## Prompts

system: ""”

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 

Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, following the instructions provided.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words That Can Be Synonymous Adjectives

1. **SUBSTANCE**: This word can be an adjective in the sense of "substantial" or "having substance."
2. **CORE**: This word can be an adjective meaning "central" or "essential."

Both "substantial" and "essential" can be synonymous in certain contexts, as they both imply something fundamental or important.

### Step 2: See If Other Puzzle Words Can Also Be Synonymous

Let's examine the other words to see if they can fit into this pattern:

3. **MEAT**: This can be an adjective in the sense of "meaty," which can mean "substantial" or "having substance."
4. **THRUST**: This is a bit tricky, but "thrust" can imply "main point" or "core idea," which aligns with "central" or "essential."

### Group of Four Puzzle Words

Based on the analysis above, we can propose the following group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives:

- **SUBSTANCE** (substantial)
- **CORE** (central, essential)
- **MEAT** (meaty, substantial)
- **THRUST** (main point, core)

These words can all be used as adjectives to describe something that is fundamental, important, or substantial in nature.

If this doesn't seem to fit the pattern, we can try another approach or look for a different set of synonyms. Let me know if you want to explore further!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding synonyms that function as the same part of speech.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms.**

1. **PUSH-UP and THRUST**: Both can function as verbs meaning "to exert force" or "to push forward."

2. **BIG and CORE**: These don't seem to be synonyms, so let's try another pair.

3. **EARLY and DEMI**: These don't seem to be synonyms either.

4. **LADY and DEMI**: These don't seem to be synonyms either.

5. **WIRELESS and SUBSTANCE**: These don't seem to be synonyms either.

6. **SUE and DEMI**: These don't seem to be synonyms either.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.**

Let's focus on the first pair we identified: **PUSH-UP and THRUST**.

- **SPORTS**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **BIG**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **CORE**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **EARLY**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **LADY**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **WIRELESS**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **DEMI**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **MEAT**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **SUBSTANCE**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.
- **SUE**: This doesn't seem to fit as a synonym with PUSH-UP and THRUST.

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's go through the steps to identify a possible solution to this puzzle.

**Step 1: Identify letters or words that commonly follow these puzzle words**

1. **DEMI** - god, moore, tasse, john
2. **MEAT** - ball, loaf, head, market
3. **SUE** - storm, ellen, happy, grafton
4. **WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, router
5. **LADY** - bug, bird, gaga, luck
6. **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, matter, control
7. **SPORTS** - car, center, bar, wear
8. **PUSH-UP** - bra, exercise, challenge, position
9. **BIG** - ben, bang, apple, deal
10. **CORE** - strength, value, group, temperature
11. **EARLY** - bird, riser, adopter, morning
12. **THRUST** - vector, stage, force, bearing

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same letters or words that commonly follow them**

Let's look for a common set of letters or words that can follow these puzzle words:

- **LADY** - bug
- **EARLY** - bird
- **SPORTS** - car
- **BIG** - ben

These words don't seem to have a common set of letters or words that follow them. Let's try another approach.

- **DEMI** - god
- **LADY** - gaga
- **BIG** - ben
- **EARLY** - bird

These words also don't seem to have a common set of letters or words that follow them. Let's try another approach.

- **MEAT** - ball
- **SPORTS** - car
- **WIRELESS** - network
- **SUBSTANCE** - abuse

These words also don't seem to have a common set of letters or words that follow them. Let's try another approach.

- **PUSH-UP** - bra
- **CORE** - strength
- **THRUST** - vector
- **WIRELESS** - router

These words also don't seem to have a common set of letters or words that follow them. Let's try another approach.

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have the same letters follow them**

After examining the list, it seems that none of the words can be grouped into a set of four that share a common set of letters or words that follow them. 

If you have any other ideas or patterns to explore, let me know, and we can try another approach.

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, looking for connections between the words that might indicate they are different aspects of the same thing.

1. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to the material or essence of something.

2. **CORE**: This often refers to the central or most important part of something.

3. **THRUST**: This can refer to the main point or essence of an argument or action, or the force applied to move something.

4. **EARLY**: This could refer to the beginning or initial stage of something.

5. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without physical connections, often related to communication.

6. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games, often competitive.

7. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half or partial, often used in contexts like "demigod" or "demitasse."

8. **SUE**: This refers to the act of bringing a legal action against someone.

9. **LADY**: This refers to a woman, often with connotations of respect or nobility.

10. **PUSH-UP**: This is a physical exercise.

11. **BIG**: This refers to size or importance.

12. **MEAT**: This refers to the flesh of animals used as food, or metaphorically, the substance or core of an argument.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, THRUST**: These words can all relate to the essence or main part of something. "Substance" and "core" are directly related to the central part or essence. "Meat" can be used metaphorically to describe the main part of an argument or discussion. "Thrust" can refer to the main point or driving force behind an argument or action.

This group seems to fit the pattern of being different aspects of the same thing, specifically the essence or main part of something.

If this solution seems plausible, we can consider it as a potential answer. If not, we can continue to explore other combinations. Let me know if you want to explore further or if this solution works for you.

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential pop culture references that could connect four of these words.

1. **PUSH-UP**: This could refer to a type of exercise or a type of bra. In pop culture, it might be associated with fitness or fashion.

2. **MEAT**: This could refer to food, but in pop culture, it might be associated with "Meat Loaf," the rock musician, or "Meat" from the movie "Rocky."

3. **LADY**: This could refer to "Lady Gaga," a pop megastar, or "My Fair Lady," a famous musical.

4. **DEMI**: This could refer to "Demi Lovato," a pop singer, or "Demi Moore," an actress.

5. **SPORTS**: This could refer to athletics in general, or it might be associated with "Sports Illustrated," a famous magazine.

6. **THRUST**: This could refer to a physical action, but in pop culture, it might be associated with "Thrust" from the Transformers series.

7. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to technology, like wireless internet, or it might be associated with "Wireless Festival," a music festival.

8. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something, or in pop culture, it might be associated with "Core" from the video game series "Dead Space."

9. **EARLY**: This could refer to time, but in pop culture, it might be associated with "Early Edition," a TV show.

10. **BIG**: This could refer to size, or in pop culture, it might be associated with "Big" the movie starring Tom Hanks, or "Notorious B.I.G.," the rapper.

11. **SUE**: This could refer to a legal action, or in pop culture, it might be associated with "Sue Sylvester," a character from the TV show "Glee."

12. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to material, or in pop culture, it might be associated with "Substance," a compilation album by New Order.

Now, let's try to find a group of four words that share a pop culture reference:

- **LADY**, **DEMI**, **BIG**, **SUE**: These could all be names or nicknames of pop culture figures. "Lady" for Lady Gaga, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, "Big" for Notorious B.I.G., and "Sue" for Sue Sylvester from "Glee."

This group seems to fit the pattern of being names or nicknames of pop culture figures. Let's go with this combination as a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another approach.
