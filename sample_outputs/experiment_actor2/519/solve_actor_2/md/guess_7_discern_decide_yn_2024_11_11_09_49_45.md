system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and see if any of them fit well with the given words:

1. **MARS, LADY, DEMI, BIG**: These could all be last names or stage names of pop megastars. However, as noted, "Demi" is more commonly known as a first name rather than a last name or stage name, which weakens this connection slightly.

2. **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**: These words can all be part of different exercise moves. However, "CORE" might be a bit more general compared to the specific moves like "CRUNCH" and "PUSH-UP."

3. **CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE**: These four words can all modify "candy," as they are all types of candy bars. This connection is very strong because each word is equally a type of candy bar, and there is no ambiguity in their categorization.

Now, let's consider the words provided: CORE, PUSH-UP, DEMI, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MARS, SUE, SPORTS, MEAT, CRUNCH, PAYDAY, DOVE, BIG, LADY, WIRELESS, EARLY.

- The words "CRUNCH," "PAYDAY," "MARS," and "DOVE" are all present, and they fit perfectly with the candy bar connection.
- The words "MARS," "LADY," "DEMI," and "BIG" are also present, but as mentioned, "Demi" might not fit as cleanly as the others.
- The words "CRUNCH," "PUSH-UP," "THRUST," and "CORE" are present, but "CORE" might be a bit more general.

Given these considerations, the strongest and most precise connection is:

**CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE**: These are all types of candy bars.

This is the top choice for a guess to submit. I recommend submitting this guess.
