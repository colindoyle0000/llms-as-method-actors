## Prompts

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and see if any of them are strong enough to submit:

1. **Exercise-related words:** CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, SPORTS
   - As noted, "SPORTS" is broader and doesn't fit as neatly into the category of specific exercises or movements. This makes this guess weaker.

2. **Words followed by "bar":** DOVE, MARS, PAYDAY, CRUNCH
   - This connection is specific and fits all four words equally well. This is a strong guess because the connection is clear and specific.

3. **Aspects of physical fitness or exercise:** THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE
   - While these words relate to physical fitness, "CORE" is more of a body part or area rather than an exercise or movement, making this guess slightly weaker.

Given these evaluations, the strongest guess is the one where the words are followed by "bar": DOVE, MARS, PAYDAY, CRUNCH. This connection is specific, clear, and fits all four words equally well.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess:

**Words followed by "bar": DOVE, MARS, PAYDAY, CRUNCH**

This seems to be the most solid option from the notes provided./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
