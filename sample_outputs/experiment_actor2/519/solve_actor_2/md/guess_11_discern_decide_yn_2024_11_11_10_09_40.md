system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's evaluate the notes and the list of words you provided to determine if we should submit a guess.

From the notes, we have two potential guesses:

1. **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, THRUST**: These words relate to the essence or main part of something. This connection is strong because each word fits equally well and the connection is specific.

2. **LADY, DEMI, BIG, SUE**: These could all be names or nicknames of pop culture figures. However, this connection is less strong due to the reliance on specific pop culture knowledge and the weaker connection of "Sue."

Now, let's compare these guesses to the list of words you provided:

- **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, THRUST**: All four words are present in your list. This connection is strong and specific, as noted.

- **LADY, DEMI, BIG, SUE**: All four words are present in your list, but the connection is weaker and less universally recognized.

Given the criteria for a strong connection—specificity, equal fit for each word, and uniqueness—the first guess, **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, THRUST**, remains the stronger choice. Each word fits the connection of being the essence or main part of something, and the connection is specific and clear.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess: **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, THRUST**.
