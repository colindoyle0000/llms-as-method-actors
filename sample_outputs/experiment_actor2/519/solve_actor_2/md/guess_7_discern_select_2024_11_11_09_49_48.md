You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and see if any of them fit well with the given words:

1. **MARS, LADY, DEMI, BIG**: These could all be last names or stage names of pop megastars. However, as noted, "Demi" is more commonly known as a first name rather than a last name or stage name, which weakens this connection slightly.

2. **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**: These words can all be part of different exercise moves. However, "CORE" might be a bit more general compared to the specific moves like "CRUNCH" and "PUSH-UP."

3. **CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE**: These four words can all modify "candy," as they are all types of candy bars. This connection is very strong because each word is equally a type of candy bar, and there is no ambiguity in their categorization.

Now, let's consider the words provided: CORE, PUSH-UP, DEMI, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MARS, SUE, SPORTS, MEAT, CRUNCH, PAYDAY, DOVE, BIG, LADY, WIRELESS, EARLY.

- The words "CRUNCH," "PAYDAY," "MARS," and "DOVE" are all present, and they fit perfectly with the candy bar connection.
- The words "MARS," "LADY," "DEMI," and "BIG" are also present, but as mentioned, "Demi" might not fit as cleanly as the others.
- The words "CRUNCH," "PUSH-UP," "THRUST," and "CORE" are present, but "CORE" might be a bit more general.

Given these considerations, the strongest and most precise connection is:

**CRUNCH, PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE**: These are all types of candy bars.

This is the top choice for a guess to submit. I recommend submitting this guess./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
