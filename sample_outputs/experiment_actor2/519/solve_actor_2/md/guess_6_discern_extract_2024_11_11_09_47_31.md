## Prompts

system: ""”

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 

Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying a pattern where four words are each a way to do the same thing.

1. **Identify potential pairs:**
   - **THRUST and PUSH-UP:** Both involve pushing or exerting force.
   - **CRUNCH and PUSH-UP:** Both are exercises.
   - **WIRELESS and CORE:** Both can relate to technology (wireless technology, core technology).
   - **SUE and PAYDAY:** Both relate to legal/financial outcomes (suing for money, payday as receiving money).

2. **Explore potential patterns:**
   - **Exercise-related words:** CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST. We need one more exercise-related word.
   - **Financial/legal outcomes:** SUE, PAYDAY. We need two more words related to financial/legal outcomes.
   - **Technology-related words:** WIRELESS, CORE. We need two more technology-related words.

3. **Re-evaluate and expand:**
   - **Exercise-related words:** CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, and possibly SPORTS (as it relates to physical activity).
   - **Financial/legal outcomes:** SUE, PAYDAY. We need to find more words that fit this category.
   - **Technology-related words:** WIRELESS, CORE. We need to find more words that fit this category.

4. **Consider other potential patterns:**
   - **Ways to exert force or pressure:** THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH. We need one more word that fits this pattern.
   - **Ways to describe something small or compact:** DEMI (meaning half or small), CORE (central part, often small), SUBSTANCE (can refer to a small amount of something), and possibly CRUNCH (as in a crunch time, a small window of time).

5. **Final attempt to find a group of four:**
   - **Exercise-related words:** CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, SPORTS.
   - **Ways to exert force or pressure:** THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, possibly SPORTS (as sports can involve physical exertion).

Based on the brainstorming, the most promising group of four words that match a pattern are exercise-related: CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, SPORTS. These words all relate to physical activity or exercises. 

If this doesn't seem correct, we can try another pattern or re-evaluate the words. Let me know if you want to explore another angle!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words That Can Be Synonymous Adjectives

1. **BIG**: This can be an adjective meaning large or significant.
2. **EARLY**: This can be an adjective meaning happening or done before the usual or expected time.

These two words don't seem to be synonymous, so let's try another pair.

1. **CORE**: This can be an adjective meaning central or essential.
2. **SUBSTANCE**: This can be an adjective meaning substantial or significant.

Again, these don't seem to match as synonyms. Let's try another pair.

1. **DEMI**: This can be an adjective meaning half or partial.
2. **LADY**: This can be an adjective meaning refined or elegant.

These don't match either. Let's try another pair.

1. **WIRELESS**: This can be an adjective meaning without wires or cordless.
2. **SPORTS**: This can be an adjective meaning athletic or related to sports.

These don't match either. Let's try another pair.

1. **THRUST**: This can be an adjective meaning forceful or vigorous.
2. **CRUNCH**: This can be an adjective meaning critical or decisive.

These don't match either. Let's try another pair.

1. **SUE**: This can be an adjective meaning litigious or legal.
2. **DOVE**: This can be an adjective meaning peaceful or gentle.

These don't match either. Let's try another pair.

1. **PAYDAY**: This can be an adjective meaning lucrative or profitable.
2. **MEAT**: This can be an adjective meaning substantial or significant.

These don't match either. Let's try another pair.

### Step 2: See If Other Puzzle Words Can Also Be Synonymous

Let's try to find a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives:

1. **BIG**: Large, significant.
2. **CORE**: Central, essential.
3. **SUBSTANCE**: Substantial, significant.
4. **MEAT**: Substantial, significant.

These words don't all match as synonyms. Let's try another group.

1. **THRUST**: Forceful, vigorous.
2. **CRUNCH**: Critical, decisive.
3. **PUSH-UP**: Forceful, vigorous.
4. **SPORTS**: Athletic, vigorous.

These words don't all match as synonyms. Let's try another group.

1. **WIRELESS**: Cordless, without wires.
2. **EARLY**: Premature, ahead of time.
3. **DEMI**: Partial, half.
4. **LADY**: Refined, elegant.

These words don't all match as synonyms. Let's try another group.

### Conclusion

After going through the list, I couldn't find a group of four words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other. It might be worth trying another pattern or looking for more unique or specific synonyms. Let me know if you want to try a different approach or pattern.

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding synonyms that function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms.

1. **EARLY**: This is an adjective meaning "before the usual or expected time."
2. **BIG**: This is an adjective meaning "large in size or extent."

These two words don't seem to be synonymous, so let's try another pair.

1. **THRUST**: This can be a verb meaning "to push with force."
2. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun referring to an exercise, but if we consider "PUSH" as a verb, it can mean "to apply force to move something."

These two words can be synonymous as verbs meaning "to apply force."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.

Let's look for other words that can be synonymous with "THRUST" and "PUSH" as verbs:

1. **CRUNCH**: This can be a verb meaning "to crush with a noisy crackling sound," but it doesn't quite fit the "apply force" meaning.
2. **SUE**: This is a verb meaning "to take legal action," which doesn't fit.
3. **WIRELESS**: This is an adjective, so it doesn't fit.
4. **DEMI**: This is an adjective meaning "half" or "partly," so it doesn't fit.
5. **CORE**: This can be a verb meaning "to remove the central part," but it doesn't fit the "apply force" meaning.
6. **SPORTS**: This is a noun, so it doesn't fit.
7. **LADY**: This is a noun, so it doesn't fit.
8. **PAYDAY**: This is a noun, so it doesn't fit.
9. **MARS**: This is a noun, so it doesn't fit.
10. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a noun, so it doesn't fit.
11. **DOVE**: This can be a verb (past tense of "dive"), but it doesn't fit the "apply force" meaning.

It seems challenging to find four words that fit the pattern of being synonymous verbs meaning "to apply force." Let's try another approach.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms.

1. **BIG**: Adjective meaning "large in size or extent."
2. **DEMI**: Adjective meaning "half" or "partly," which doesn't fit.

Let's try another pair.

1. **CORE**: This can be a noun meaning "the central or most important part."
2. **SUBSTANCE**: This can be a noun meaning "the essential nature or most important part of something."

These two words can be synonymous as nouns meaning "the essential part."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.

Let's look for other words that can be synonymous with "CORE" and "SUBSTANCE" as nouns:

1. **MEAT**: This can be a noun meaning "the flesh of an animal," but it can also mean "the essential part of something," fitting the pattern.
2. **CRUNCH**: This is more of an action or sound, so it doesn't fit.
3. **SPORTS**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
4. **LADY**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
5. **PAYDAY**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
6. **MARS**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
7. **DOVE**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
8. **WIRELESS**: This is an adjective, so it doesn't fit.
9. **THRUST**: This is a verb, so it doesn't fit.
10. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun, but it doesn't fit the "essential part" meaning.
11. **SUE**: This is a verb, so it doesn't fit.
12. **EARLY**: This is an adjective, so it doesn't fit.

We have identified three words: CORE, SUBSTANCE, and MEAT, that can be synonymous as nouns meaning "the essential part." Unfortunately, we couldn't find a fourth word that fits this pattern.

If we can't find a fourth word, we might need to consider a different pattern or re-evaluate the list for other potential synonyms. Let me know if you want to try another approach or if there's anything else I can do to help.

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's examine the list of words provided to see what set of letters commonly follow these words, then identify words that have the same letters that commonly follow them:

**Step 1: Identify letters that follow these puzzle words**

1. **CRUNCH** - y, ing, er, es
2. **BIG** - shot, time, deal, ben
3. **SPORTS** - car, man, wear, caster
4. **MEAT** - ball, loaf, head, pack
5. **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, over, free
6. **SUE** - ing, d, s, per
7. **DEMI** - god, tasse, john, monde
8. **DOVE** - tail, soap, coat, bar
9. **MARS** - bar, rover, lander, mission
10. **THRUST** - er, ing, ed, s
11. **CORE** - value, strength, team, temperature
12. **WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, access
13. **LADY** - bug, bird, ship, finger
14. **PUSH-UP** - bra, bar, challenge, position
15. **PAYDAY** - loan, bar, candy, advance
16. **EARLY** - bird, riser, adopter, warning

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same letters that commonly follow them**

1. **DOVE** - bar
2. **MARS** - bar
3. **PAYDAY** - bar
4. **CRUNCH** - bar

These puzzle words are all commonly followed by "bar."

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have the same letters follow them**

Already found four words followed by “bar”:

1. **DOVE** - bar
2. **MARS** - bar
3. **PAYDAY** - bar
4. **CRUNCH** - bar

This group of four words can each be followed by "bar." 

Let me know if you need further assistance or if you'd like to try another pattern.

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying connections between the words that could represent different aspects of the same thing.

1. **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: Both words relate to force or movement. "Thrust" is a forceful push, and "push-up" is an exercise involving pushing one's body up.

2. **CRUNCH and CORE**: Both words can relate to fitness. "Crunch" is an exercise targeting the abdominal muscles, and "core" refers to the central muscles of the body, including the abdominals.

3. **WIRELESS and EARLY**: These words don't seem to have a direct connection. Let's set them aside for now.

4. **SUE and PAYDAY**: "Sue" involves legal action, often for financial compensation, which could lead to a "payday" if the lawsuit is successful.

5. **DOVE and LADY**: Both words can be associated with peace and gentleness. "Dove" is a symbol of peace, and "lady" can imply grace and gentility.

6. **MARS and SPORTS**: "Mars" is the Roman god of war, and "sports" can be seen as a form of competitive combat or battle.

7. **DEMI and BIG**: "Demi" means half or partial, while "big" refers to size. These words don't seem to connect directly.

8. **SUBSTANCE and MEAT**: Both words can refer to the essential part of something. "Substance" is the essential nature, and "meat" can be the core or main part of a discussion or argument.

Now, let's try to form a group of four words that are different aspects of the same thing:

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE**: These words all relate to aspects of physical fitness or exercise, specifically involving strength and core workouts.

This seems like a plausible solution. If this doesn't fit the intended pattern, we can explore other combinations. Let me know if you need further assistance or if we should try another pattern.
 *** 


Your response should consist of each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
