system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully analyze the notes and the list of words to determine if we should submit a guess.

The notes provide three potential solutions, all of which involve the words **THRUST, CORE, MEAT,** and **SUBSTANCE**. These words are said to relate to the concept of "essence" or "central part." Let's evaluate this connection:

1. **THRUST**: Can refer to the main point or driving force.
2. **CORE**: Often used to describe the central or most important part.
3. **MEAT**: Can metaphorically refer to the substance or main part of something.
4. **SUBSTANCE**: Refers to the essential nature or most important part.

These words do seem to fit well together under the concept of "essence" or "central part." Importantly, none of the other words in the list (WIRELESS, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, LADY, EARLY, DEMI, SUE, BIG) fit this connection as well as these four words do.

The notes suggest that this is a strong connection, and it appears to be unique to these four words. There are no indications that this guess has been previously submitted and found incorrect.

Given this analysis, it seems that submitting the guess **THRUST, CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE** is a strong option. It fits the criteria of having a unique and specific connection that applies equally to all four words.

Therefore, I recommend submitting this guess.
