Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully analyze the notes and the words provided to determine if there's a strong guess to submit.

From the notes, we have the following possible guesses:

1. **WIRELESS, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, CORE**: This group was considered but "wireless" felt out of place compared to the others, which are more directly related to physical exercises.

2. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, PUSH-UP**: This group was identified as having a strong connection related to physical fitness or exercise, as all words can be related to physical exertion or fitness activities.

3. **WIRELESS, SPORTS, THRUST, PUSH-UP**: This group was considered but "wireless" again felt slightly out of place compared to the others.

The notes indicate that the guess **CORE, DEMI, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** was incorrect. Therefore, we should not submit this guess.

Given the analysis, the group **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, PUSH-UP** was identified as having the strongest connection related to physical fitness or exercise. However, since the notes indicate that **CORE, DEMI, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** was incorrect, and considering the potential overlap in themes, it's possible that the connection we identified might not be correct either.

Since the notes suggest that the guess **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, PUSH-UP** was not explicitly marked as incorrect, and it was identified as the strongest connection, it might still be worth considering. However, given the uncertainty and the fact that a similar guess was incorrect, it might be prudent to go back to brainstorming other possible connections.

In conclusion, I recommend going back to brainstorming other possible connections, as the current options do not provide a sufficiently strong guess to submit with confidence.

user: Yes = submit a guess. No = go back to brainstorming.
