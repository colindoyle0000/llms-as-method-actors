You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's evaluate the notes and the list of words you provided to determine if we should submit a guess.

From the notes, we have two potential guesses:

1. **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, THRUST**: These words relate to the essence or main part of something. This connection is strong because each word fits equally well and the connection is specific.

2. **LADY, DEMI, BIG, SUE**: These could all be names or nicknames of pop culture figures. However, this connection is less strong due to the reliance on specific pop culture knowledge and the weaker connection of "Sue."

Now, let's compare these guesses to the list of words you provided:

- **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, THRUST**: All four words are present in your list. This connection is strong and specific, as noted.

- **LADY, DEMI, BIG, SUE**: All four words are present in your list, but the connection is weaker and less universally recognized.

Given the criteria for a strong connection—specificity, equal fit for each word, and uniqueness—the first guess, **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, THRUST**, remains the stronger choice. Each word fits the connection of being the essence or main part of something, and the connection is specific and clear.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess: **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, THRUST**./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
