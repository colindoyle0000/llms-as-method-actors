You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and determine if any are strong enough to submit:

1. **LADY, DEMI, PUSH-UP, CORE**: The connection here is related to types or parts of bras. However, "Lady" doesn't fit as cleanly as the other words, making this connection weaker.

2. **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI, CORE**: This connection relates to types or features of bras. All four words fit well within this context, making it a strong and cohesive connection.

3. **DOVE, BIG, SUE, CORE**: The connection here is that each word can be changed by one letter to form a verb. This is a clever connection but relies on a more abstract transformation.

Given these evaluations, the second guess, **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI, CORE**, seems to be the strongest. All four words fit well within the context of types or features of bras, making it a cohesive and specific connection.

Therefore, I recommend submitting **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI, CORE** as a guess for the puzzle./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
