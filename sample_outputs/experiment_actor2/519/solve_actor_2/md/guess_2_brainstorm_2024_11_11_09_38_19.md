Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are different aspects of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. Describe the connection between the puzzle words as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Words that are each different aspects of the sharpness as of an image: CLARITY DEFINITION DETAIL RESOLUTION
Words that are each different aspects of plant growths: BLOOM BUD SHOOT SPROUT
Words that are each different aspects of bee creations: COMB HIVE HONEY WAX
Words that are each different aspects of movie summary info: CAST GENRE PLOT TITLE
Words that are each different aspects of sheet music: CLEF NOTE REST STAFF
Words that are each different aspects of solar emanations: CORONA FLARE LIGHT RADIATION

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be different aspects of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing, start over at Step 1.



If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT SUE PUSH-UP WIRELESS SPORTS EARLY SUBSTANCE CRUNCH DOVE CORE PAYDAY LADY MARS BIG THRUST DEMI

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying connections between the words that could represent different aspects of the same thing.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **MEAT and SUBSTANCE**: Both can be considered aspects of food or nutrition. "Meat" is a type of food, and "substance" can refer to the nutritional content or the essence of food.

2. **WIRELESS and EARLY**: These could be aspects of technology or communication. "Wireless" refers to a type of technology, and "early" could refer to the early stages of technological development.

3. **SPORTS and CRUNCH**: These could be aspects of physical fitness. "Sports" is a form of physical activity, and "crunch" is a type of exercise.

4. **CORE and CRUNCH**: Both relate to fitness, specifically exercises targeting the core muscles.

### Step 2: Expand to Four Words

Let's try to expand on these initial connections:

1. **MEAT, SUBSTANCE, CORE, CRUNCH**: These could all relate to aspects of nutrition and fitness. "Meat" and "substance" are related to nutrition, while "core" and "crunch" are related to fitness exercises.

2. **WIRELESS, EARLY, PUSH-UP, THRUST**: These could relate to aspects of technology and innovation. "Wireless" and "early" relate to technology, while "push-up" and "thrust" could metaphorically relate to advancements or movements in technology.

3. **SPORTS, CRUNCH, CORE, PUSH-UP**: These are all aspects of physical fitness. "Sports" is a general term for physical activity, "crunch" and "push-up" are specific exercises, and "core" refers to the muscle group targeted by these exercises.

### Conclusion

The most promising group seems to be **SPORTS, CRUNCH, CORE, PUSH-UP**, as they all relate to different aspects of physical fitness. "Sports" is the general activity, "crunch" and "push-up" are specific exercises, and "core" is the muscle group involved.

If this doesn't fit the pattern, we can explore other combinations or start over with a new approach. Let me know if you need further assistance or if we should try another pattern.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that share a pop culture reference

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle pop culture references are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious pop culture references. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words share a pop culture reference.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the name of jazz legends: HANCOCK HOLIDAY MONK PARKER
Puzzle words that are each last names of superheroes: BANNER PRINCE STARK WAYNE
Puzzle words that are each TV shows with happy-sounding names: CHEERS EUPHORIA FELICITY GLEE
Puzzle words that are each things in “my favorite things”: KETTLES MITTENS RAINDROPS WHISKERS
Puzzle words that are each the name of an NBA team player: CLIPPER PACER ROCKET SPUR
Puzzle words that are each the name of a famous guitarist: BERRY KING PAGE WATERS
Puzzle words that are each the name of a famous poem: DADDY HARLEM HOWL IF
Puzzle words that are each the last name of a pop megastar: GRANDE MARS STYLES SWIFT
Puzzle words that are each rooms in the game clue: HALL LIBRARY LOUNGE STUDY
Puzzle words that are each lands at Disneyland: ADVENTURE FANTASY FRONTIER TOMORROW

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by sharing the same pop culture reference. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: PAYDAY DOVE THRUST PUSH-UP WIRELESS SPORTS SUE DEMI LADY MARS CRUNCH BIG EARLY MEAT SUBSTANCE CORE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying potential pop culture references among the given words. We'll start by looking for connections between two words and then see if we can expand that to a group of four.

1. **PAYDAY and MARS**: Both are names of candy bars. This could be a potential pop culture reference related to popular candy brands.

2. **DOVE and MARS**: Continuing with the candy theme, Dove is also a brand of chocolate, and Mars is a well-known candy company. 

3. **CRUNCH**: This is another candy bar brand, Nestlé Crunch, which fits the candy theme.

4. **LADY and DEMI**: Both could refer to pop stars (Lady Gaga and Demi Lovato), but let's see if we can find more words to fit this theme.

5. **BIG and EARLY**: These could be part of phrases or titles, but they don't immediately suggest a pop culture reference.

6. **WIRELESS and SPORTS**: These could relate to technology or broadcasting, but it's not a strong pop culture reference.

7. **SUE and DEMI**: Both could be first names of famous people (Sue Sylvester from "Glee" and Demi Lovato), but again, we need more words to fit this theme.

8. **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: These are both exercise-related, but not a pop culture reference.

9. **SUBSTANCE and CORE**: These could relate to fitness or health, but not a strong pop culture reference.

Based on the above analysis, the strongest connection seems to be the candy theme. Let's see if we can find four words that fit this theme:

- **PAYDAY**: Candy bar
- **MARS**: Candy company
- **DOVE**: Chocolate brand
- **CRUNCH**: Candy bar

These four words all relate to candy brands, which is a pop culture reference. This seems like a plausible solution to the puzzle. If this doesn't work, we can explore other potential connections, but this is a strong candidate based on the given words.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can mean the same thing. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can mean the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can mean the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “how fast something is going”: CLIP PACE RATE SPEED
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to fail to attend”: CUT DITCH MISS SKIP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to become aware of”: DISCOVER FIND LEARN REALIZE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to apply pressure to”: CRUSH MASH PRESS SQUASH
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to chat informally”: GAB JAW YAK YAP
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “pretense”: AFFECT AIRS CHARADE FRONT
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “foolishness”: ABSURDITY FOLLY MADNESS NONSENSE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to move forward”: ADVANCE MARCH PROGRESS PUSH
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to get smaller”: CONTRACT LESSEN REDUCE SHRINK
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to criticize”: BLAST KNOCK SLAM TRASH

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DOVE WIRELESS CORE SUBSTANCE PUSH-UP DEMI CRUNCH EARLY PAYDAY THRUST MARS MEAT SPORTS SUE BIG LADY

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying words that can mean the same thing and function as the same part of speech.

1. **DOVE**: This can be a noun (the bird) or a verb (past tense of "dive"). As a noun, it might not have many synonyms in this list. As a verb, it could relate to "THRUST" or "PUSH-UP" in terms of movement, but let's keep it in mind.

2. **WIRELESS**: This is an adjective or noun, often referring to technology without wires. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym from the list.

3. **CORE**: This can be a noun (the central part of something) or a verb (to remove the core of something). As a noun, it might relate to "SUBSTANCE" or "MEAT" in terms of being the essential part.

4. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a noun meaning the material or essential part of something. It could relate to "CORE" or "MEAT."

5. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun (an exercise) or a verb (to push something up). As a verb, it might relate to "THRUST."

6. **DEMI**: This is an adjective meaning half or partial. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym from the list.

7. **CRUNCH**: This can be a noun (a sound or exercise) or a verb (to crush something noisily). As a noun, it might relate to "PUSH-UP" in terms of exercise.

8. **EARLY**: This is an adjective or adverb meaning before the usual time. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym from the list.

9. **PAYDAY**: This is a noun meaning the day on which one receives payment. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym from the list.

10. **THRUST**: This can be a noun (a forceful push) or a verb (to push forcefully). As a verb, it might relate to "PUSH-UP."

11. **MARS**: This can be a noun (the planet) or a verb (to damage). As a verb, it might relate to "SUE" in terms of causing harm.

12. **MEAT**: This is a noun meaning the flesh of an animal or the essential part of something. It could relate to "CORE" or "SUBSTANCE."

13. **SPORTS**: This is a noun meaning physical activities or games. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym from the list.

14. **SUE**: This is a verb meaning to take legal action. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym from the list.

15. **BIG**: This is an adjective meaning large. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym from the list.

16. **LADY**: This is a noun meaning a woman. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym from the list.

Now, let's try to form a group of four words that can mean the same thing:

- **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT**: These can all be nouns meaning the essential part of something.
- We need one more word to complete the group. "CRUNCH" as a noun doesn't fit, but as a verb, it might relate to "THRUST" or "PUSH-UP" in terms of forceful action.

Let's try another angle:

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH**: These can all be verbs related to forceful movement or action.
- We need one more word to complete the group. "DOVE" as a verb (past tense of "dive") might relate to movement, but it's not a perfect fit.

Given the constraints, let's focus on the first group:

- **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT**: These are strong candidates for the same meaning as nouns.
- We need to find a fourth word that fits this pattern. "DEMI" doesn't fit, but "WIRELESS" as a concept might relate to the essential part of technology, though it's a stretch.

If we can't find a perfect fourth word, we might need to consider a different pattern or ask for more context. Let's go with:

- **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, [fourth word needed]**

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can each be a part of a different word within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories. As precisely as possible, describe how each of the two puzzle words can be part of a different word within the same category.

Puzzle words that are each the first letters of the name of a planet: EAR MAR MER SAT
Puzzle words that each start with letters that form the name of a rock band: CREAMSICLE JOURNEYMAN KISSCAM RUSHMORE

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST DEMI LADY MARS SUBSTANCE PAYDAY CRUNCH BIG PUSH-UP WIRELESS EARLY CORE SPORTS DOVE MEAT SUE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying a category that can link four of these words together.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both of these words can be associated with exercises or movements in fitness. "Thrust" is a movement often used in exercises like hip thrusts, and "push-up" is a common exercise.

2. **MARS** and **EARLY**: These could be related to time or space. "Mars" is a planet, and "early" could relate to time, but they don't seem to fit a specific category together.

3. **WIRELESS** and **CORE**: These could relate to technology. "Wireless" is a type of technology, and "core" could refer to the central part of a computer processor.

### Step 2: Explore Other Words

Let's focus on the fitness/exercise category for now:

- **THRUST**: As mentioned, relates to a movement in exercises.
- **PUSH-UP**: A specific exercise.
- **CRUNCH**: Another exercise, specifically for the abdominal muscles.
- **BIG**: This is a bit tricky, but in fitness, "big" could refer to muscle growth or size, often a goal of exercising.

### Step 3: Verify the Category

The category of "fitness/exercise" seems to fit well with these words:

- **THRUST**: Hip thrusts, a common exercise.
- **PUSH-UP**: A classic bodyweight exercise.
- **CRUNCH**: An abdominal exercise.
- **BIG**: Often used in the context of building muscle size.

### Conclusion

The four words that fit the pattern of being parts of different words within the "fitness/exercise" category are:

- **THRUST**
- **PUSH-UP**
- **CRUNCH**
- **BIG**

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can explore other categories or combinations. Let me know if you want to try a different approach or pattern!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each modify the same word

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that each puzzle word can modify. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words rather than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each modify “pepper”: BELL BLACK DR GHOST
Puzzle words that each modify “trap”: BEAR SAND SPEED TOURIST
Puzzle words that each modify “hour”: AMATEUR ELEVENTH HAPPY RUSH
Puzzle words that each modify “dream”: AMERICAN FEVER LUCID PIPE
Puzzle words that each modify “bat”: BASEBALL CRICKET FRUIT VAMPIRE

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can each modify the same word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so a unique and particular word being modified is more likely to be correct than a generic and ubiquitous word.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can modify that same word. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each modify the same word.
