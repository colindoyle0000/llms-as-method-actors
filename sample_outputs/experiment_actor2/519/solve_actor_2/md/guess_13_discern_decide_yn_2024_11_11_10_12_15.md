system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's evaluate the two guesses from the notes and see if either is strong enough to submit:

1. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**:
   - **Explanation**: These words are related to physical exercise or fitness. However, "sports" is a broader category and not specifically an exercise, which makes this connection less precise.

2. **CORE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**:
   - **Explanation**: These words connect to different meanings of the word "essence" or "central part." "Core" and "substance" fit well with this theme. "Thrust" as the main point or force also aligns with this idea. "Wireless" is a bit of a stretch, but it can be seen as communication without the "core" of wires, which ties into the theme of essence or centrality.

Given the options, the second guess, **CORE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**, seems to have a more unique and precise connection, which aligns with the typical complexity of New York Times puzzles. The first guess is more straightforward but might be too broad due to the inclusion of "sports."

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess **CORE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**. This guess has a more nuanced connection that fits the criteria for a strong guess in this type of puzzle.
