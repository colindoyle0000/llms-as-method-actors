## Prompts

system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and see if any of them are strong enough to submit:

1. **Exercise-related words:** CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, SPORTS
   - As noted, "SPORTS" is broader and doesn't fit as neatly into the category of specific exercises or movements. This makes this guess weaker.

2. **Words followed by "bar":** DOVE, MARS, PAYDAY, CRUNCH
   - This connection is specific and fits all four words equally well. This is a strong guess because the connection is clear and specific.

3. **Aspects of physical fitness or exercise:** THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE
   - While these words relate to physical fitness, "CORE" is more of a body part or area rather than an exercise or movement, making this guess slightly weaker.

Given these evaluations, the strongest guess is the one where the words are followed by "bar": DOVE, MARS, PAYDAY, CRUNCH. This connection is specific, clear, and fits all four words equally well.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess:

**Words followed by "bar": DOVE, MARS, PAYDAY, CRUNCH**

This seems to be the most solid option from the notes provided.
