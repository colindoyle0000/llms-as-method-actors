Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are parts of the same thing or process

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the puzzle words are parts of the same thing or process.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each parts of a car: BUMPER HOOD TIRE TRUNK
Puzzle words that are each cuts of pork: BELLY CHOP HOCK SHOULDER
Puzzle words that are each seen in a laundry room: DRYER HAMPER IRON WASHER
Puzzle words that are each sections of a book: APPENDIX CHAPTER INDEX PREFACE
Puzzle words that are each things used to build a snowman: CARROT COAL SNOW STICKS
Puzzle words that are each parts of a golf course: BUNKER FAIRWAY GREEN ROUGH
Puzzle words that are each pinball machine components: BALL BUMPER FLIPPER PLUNGER
Puzzle words that are each parts of a shoe: EYELET LACE SOLE TONGUE
Puzzle words that are each parts of a river: BANK BED DELTA MOUTH
Puzzle words that are each in the nato alphabet: ALFA BRAVO ROMEO TANGO

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by being part of the same thing or process. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: LADY BIG PUSH-UP CORE SPORTS SUBSTANCE EARLY THRUST WIRELESS DEMI SUE DOVE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We'll look for subtle and unique connections that might not be immediately obvious.

1. **LADY and DEMI**: Both words can be associated with types of bras. "Lady" could refer to a brand or style, and "Demi" is a type of bra cup.

2. **PUSH-UP**: This is another type of bra, specifically designed to enhance cleavage.

3. **CORE**: In the context of bras, "core" could refer to the central part of the bra that connects the cups.

So, one possible connection could be that these words are all related to types or parts of bras: LADY, DEMI, PUSH-UP, CORE.

Let's see if we can find another set of words that fit a different pattern:

1. **BIG and EARLY**: These could be related to stages or descriptions of something, but it's not clear what yet.

2. **THRUST**: This could relate to movement or force, possibly in a mechanical or physical context.

3. **WIRELESS**: This could relate to technology or communication.

4. **SPORTS**: This could relate to activities or equipment.

5. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a broad term that could relate to materials or chemistry.

6. **SUE and DOVE**: These seem more like names, but "Dove" could also refer to the bird or the brand.

Given the initial set of words related to bras, let's see if we can find another set:

- **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI, CORE**: These could all relate to types or features of bras, especially sports bras, which often have a core support structure and can come in push-up or demi styles.

If this doesn't seem to fit, we might need to consider other patterns or connections. Let me know if you want to explore a different angle or if you have any other ideas!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous verbs.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to shepherd”: DIRECT GUIDE LEAD STEER
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to contact via phone”: BUZZ CALL DIAL RING
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to separate”: DIVIDE FORK PART SPLIT
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to pester”: BADGER BUG HOUND NAG
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to get low”: CROUCH DUCK SQUAT STOOP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to make happy”: AMUSE DELIGHT PLEASE TICKLE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to reserve for later”: BANK SAVE STASH STORE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to restrain”: CHECK CURB LIMIT STEM
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to move quickly”: BOLT DART DASH ZIP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to update for accuracy”: AMEND CORRECT FIX REVISE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to breathe heavily”: GASPS HUFFS PANTS PUFFS

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: LADY THRUST SPORTS EARLY CORE DOVE SUE SUBSTANCE WIRELESS DEMI PUSH-UP BIG

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential synonymous verbs among the given words. 

1. **Identify potential verbs:**
   - **THRUST**: This can be a verb meaning to push or shove something with force.
   - **PUSH-UP**: While typically a noun referring to an exercise, "push" can be a verb meaning to apply force to move something away.
   - **DOVE**: The past tense of "dive," which is a verb meaning to plunge or move quickly downward.
   - **SUE**: This is a verb meaning to initiate legal proceedings against someone.

2. **Look for synonyms:**
   - **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both involve the action of applying force to move something. "Thrust" and "push" can be considered synonymous in the context of exerting force.
   - **DOVE**: This doesn't seem to fit with the others in terms of synonymous verbs related to force or movement.
   - **SUE**: This is unrelated to the others in terms of meaning.

3. **Re-evaluate and explore other words:**
   - **CORE**: As a verb, it can mean to remove the central part of something, but it doesn't fit with the others.
   - **WIRELESS**: Not typically a verb.
   - **BIG**: Not a verb.
   - **LADY, SPORTS, EARLY, DEMI, SUBSTANCE**: None of these are typically used as verbs.

4. **Reassess potential combinations:**
   - **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP** are the closest in terms of synonymous verbs related to force or movement.
   - We need two more words that can fit this pattern.

5. **Consider alternative interpretations:**
   - If we consider "THRUST" and "PUSH-UP" as verbs related to movement or force, we might need to think outside the box for other words that can fit this pattern.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - We have identified a potential pair with **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**, but we need two more words to complete the set of four synonymous verbs. Given the current list, it seems challenging to find two additional words that fit this pattern precisely.

If we can't find four words that follow the pattern, we might need to consider a different pattern or request additional puzzle words to work with. Let me know if you want to explore another pattern or need further assistance!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each homophones

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm potential homophones.

Step 2: Narrow down the list to only include puzzle words that are homophones.

Step 3: From the list of puzzle words that are homophones, try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that each have a common connection. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. 

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each homophones of names of animals: DEAR HAIR HOARSE WAIL
Puzzle words that are each homophones of Greek Letters: MOO NEW PIE ROW

If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over.

Example Input and Output:

Input:

Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: ANGEL, PIRATE, SPELL, WAIL, WITCH, HIVE, COMB,  WAX, DEAR, HAIR, HONEY,  HOARSE, PERIOD, STRETCH, WHILE, CLOWN

Output:

Let’s examine the list of words provided to see which ones are homophones, then narrow down the list to actual homophones, and then see if any are homophones based on a similar connection:

**Step 1: Identify Homophones**

For each word in the list, let’s say the word aloud to find out if it is a homophone

Angel - No homophone comes to mind

Pirate - No homophone comes to mind

Spell - No homophone comes to mind

Wail - Possible homophone “whale” like the sea animal

Witch - Possible homophone “which”

Hive - Possible homophone “I’ve”

Comb - Maybe a homphone of “come”

Wax - No homophone comes to mind

Dear - Possible homophone “deer”

Hair - Possible homophone “hare” or “here” or “hear”

Honey - No homophone comes to mind

Hoarse - Possible homophone “horse”

Period - No homophone comes to mind

Stretch - No homophone comes to mind

While - Possible homophone “wile” or “wild”

Clown - No homophone comes to mind

**Step 2: Narrow down list**

Wail - Possible homophone “whale” like the sea animal

Hive - Possible homophone “I’ve”

Comb - Maybe a homphone of “come”

Dear - Possible homophone “deer”

Hair - Possible homophone “hare” or “here” or “hear”

Hoarse - Possible homophone “horse”

While - Possible homophone “wile” or “wild”

**Step 3: Extract connection from list**

There does appear to be a common set of homophones here. The connection is “animal homophones” and the words are:

WAIL, DEAR, HAIR, HOARSE

— end of example input and output —

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE PUSH-UP WIRELESS LADY EARLY DEMI BIG SUE DOVE CORE THRUST SPORTS

## Output

Let's go through the steps to identify potential homophones and find a group of four words that match the pattern.

**Step 1: Identify Homophones**

For each word in the list, let's say the word aloud to find out if it is a homophone:

- Substance - No homophone comes to mind
- Push-up - No homophone comes to mind
- Wireless - No homophone comes to mind
- Lady - No homophone comes to mind
- Early - No homophone comes to mind
- Demi - No homophone comes to mind
- Big - No homophone comes to mind
- Sue - Possible homophone "sue" (legal action) or "sioux" (Native American tribe)
- Dove - Possible homophone "dove" (past tense of dive)
- Core - Possible homophone "corps" (military unit)
- Thrust - No homophone comes to mind
- Sports - No homophone comes to mind

**Step 2: Narrow down list**

From the list, the words that have potential homophones are:

- Sue - Possible homophone "sue" (legal action) or "sioux" (Native American tribe)
- Dove - Possible homophone "dove" (past tense of dive)
- Core - Possible homophone "corps" (military unit)

**Step 3: Extract connection from list**

We need to find a fourth word to complete the group of four homophones. Let's re-evaluate the list to see if we missed any potential homophones or if there's a subtle connection we can make:

- Sue - "Sioux" (Native American tribe)
- Dove - "Dove" (past tense of dive)
- Core - "Corps" (military unit)

Unfortunately, we only have three words with clear homophones. Let's consider if there might be a subtle connection or if we need to try another pattern. 

If we can't find a fourth word, we may need to explore other potential homophones or consider a different pattern. Let me know if you want to try another approach or if there's another list of words to work with.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each come after the same prefixes or words

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm prefixes or words that can come before each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular prefixes or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous prefixes or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each come after “tele”: COMMUTE MEDICINE PROMPTER VISION
Puzzle words that each come after “deep”: CUT FAKE FREEZE SIX
Puzzle words that each come after “belly”: BUTTON DANCE FLOP LAUGH

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can have the same prefix or word come before them.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same prefix or word, trying to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each have the same prefix or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: ABSURDITY PROGRESS NONSENSE ADVANCE MARCH SKUNK MADNESS PUSH CUT FREEZE FEET GARBAGE CHEESE FOLLY FAKE SIX

Output:

Let’s examine the list of puzzle words provided to see what prefixes or words come before these puzzle words, then identify puzzle words from the list that have the same prefixes or words that commonly come before them, then identify what other puzzle words could form this connection, then arrive at a conclusion.

**Step 1: Prefixes or words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**ABSURDITY** - sheer, utter, complete

**PROGRESS** - steady, significant, slow

**NONSENSE** - complete, utter, sheer

**ADVANCE** - in, rapid, significant

**MARCH** - long, slow, annual

**SKUNK** - striped, little, dead

**MADNESS** - sheer, utter, pure

**PUSH** - final, gentle, big

**CUT** - deep, budget, price

**FREEZE** - deep, sudden, hard

**FEET** - bare, tired, sore

**GARBAGE** - household, kitchen, street

**CHEESE** - cheddar, blue, cream

**FOLLY** - sheer, utter, complete

**FAKE** - news, ID, tan

**SIX** - number, at, o'clock

**Step 2: Puzzle Words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Sheer - Folly, Absurdity, Madness, Nonsense

Deep - Freeze, Cut

**Step 3: Other puzzle words that could form the connection of “deep”**

**ABSURDITY** - No

**PROGRESS** - No

**NONSENSE** - No

**ADVANCE** - No

**MARCH** - Maybe

**SKUNK** - No

**MADNESS** - No

**PUSH** - No

**FEET** - No

**GARBAGE** - No

**CHEESE** - No

**FOLLY** - No

**FAKE** - Yes!

**SIX** - Yes!

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Two good possibilities:

Puzzle Words that follow sheer: FOLLY ABSURDITY MADNESS NONSENSE

Puzzle Words that follow deep: CUT FAKE FREEZE SIX

— end of example input and output —


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS THRUST SUE EARLY DEMI LADY PUSH-UP SPORTS CORE DOVE SUBSTANCE BIG

## Output

Let's work through this step by step to find a possible solution to the puzzle.

**Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm prefixes or words that can come before each puzzle word.**

**WIRELESS** - radio, Bluetooth, network

**THRUST** - power, rocket, forward

**SUE** - file, legal, court

**EARLY** - morning, bird, riser

**DEMI** - semi, Moore, god

**LADY** - first, young, leading

**PUSH-UP** - exercise, strength, chest

**SPORTS** - team, car, news

**CORE** - apple, inner, strength

**DOVE** - peace, white, soap

**SUBSTANCE** - chemical, abuse, control

**BIG** - large, deal, time

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that can have the same prefix or word come before them.**

Let's look for common prefixes or words:

- **Power**: THRUST, CORE
- **Strength**: CORE, PUSH-UP
- **Peace**: DOVE
- **Morning**: EARLY
- **First**: LADY
- **Team**: SPORTS
- **Chemical**: SUBSTANCE
- **Large**: BIG

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same prefix or word, trying to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each have the same prefix or word.**

Let's try to find a group of four:

- **Power**: THRUST, CORE
  - No other words fit well with "power."

- **Strength**: CORE, PUSH-UP
  - No other words fit well with "strength."

- **Peace**: DOVE
  - No other words fit well with "peace."

- **Morning**: EARLY
  - No other words fit well with "morning."

- **First**: LADY
  - No other words fit well with "first."

- **Team**: SPORTS
  - No other words fit well with "team."

- **Chemical**: SUBSTANCE
  - No other words fit well with "chemical."

- **Large**: BIG
  - No other words fit well with "large."

**Step 4: Conclusion**

It seems that none of the prefixes or words we brainstormed can form a group of four puzzle words. Let's try another approach or pattern. If you have any other ideas or if we should try a different pattern, let me know!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE DOVE WIRELESS BIG SUE THRUST EARLY LADY SPORTS DEMI PUSH-UP CORE

## Output

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We need to find a group of four words from the list that are each one letter away from something else in common. 

**Step 1: Brainstorm words that are one letter away from each puzzle word.**

1. **SUBSTANCE**: Substances like "substance" could be "substance" minus a letter, but let's think of words one letter away:
   - Substance -> SubstancE (Essence)
   - Substance -> SubstancY (Substancy)

2. **DOVE**: 
   - Dove -> Love
   - Dove -> Dive
   - Dove -> Done

3. **WIRELESS**: 
   - Wireless -> Tireless
   - Wireless -> Fireless

4. **BIG**: 
   - Big -> Bag
   - Big -> Bug
   - Big -> Bit

5. **SUE**: 
   - Sue -> Use
   - Sue -> Sub

6. **THRUST**: 
   - Thrust -> Trust
   - Thrust -> Thrusts

7. **EARLY**: 
   - Early -> Yearly
   - Early -> Eerily

8. **LADY**: 
   - Lady -> Lacy
   - Lady -> Laddy

9. **SPORTS**: 
   - Sports -> Sorts
   - Sports -> Ports

10. **DEMI**: 
    - Demi -> Semi
    - Demi -> Dime

11. **PUSH-UP**: 
    - Push-up -> Pushup (no hyphen)
    - Push-up -> Push-ups

12. **CORE**: 
    - Core -> Care
    - Core -> Cure

**Step 2: Identify a connection between the words that you’ve brainstormed.**

Let's look for a common theme or category among the brainstormed words:

- **Dove -> Love, Dive, Done**
- **Big -> Bag, Bug, Bit**
- **Sue -> Use, Sub**
- **Core -> Care, Cure**

One possible connection could be that these words are all verbs or actions: 
- Love, Dive, Done (past tense of do)
- Bag (as in to bag something), Bug (as in to bug someone), Bit (past tense of bite)
- Use, Sub (as in substitute)
- Care, Cure

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words can share the connection.**

Let's see if we can find four words that fit this pattern:

- **DOVE** -> Love (verb)
- **BIG** -> Bag (verb)
- **SUE** -> Use (verb)
- **CORE** -> Care (verb)

These four words (Dove, Big, Sue, Core) each have a one-letter-away word that is a verb. 

This seems to fit the pattern we're looking for. Let me know if you think this is a viable solution or if we should explore other possibilities!
