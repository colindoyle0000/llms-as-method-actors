Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous nouns.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “scheme”: PLOT PLOY RUSE TRICK
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “swindler”: CHEAT CROOK QUACK SHARK
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “curmudgeon”: CRAB CRANK GROUCH GRUMP
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “boldness”: GALL GUTS NERVE STONES
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “brief moment”: FLASH JIFFY SECOND WINK
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “comedian’s output”: BIT JOKE ROUTINE SKETCH
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “little bit” in a recipe: DASH DROP PINCH SPLASH
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “darling”: BABY BOO DEAR LOVE
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “paper” in a book: FOLIO LEAF PAGE SHEET
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “sequence”: CHAIN SERIES STRING TRAIN
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “quarrel”: FIGHT ROW SCRAP TIFF
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “portion of profit”: CUT PIECE SHARE TAKE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE WIRELESS DEMI PUSH-UP CORE LADY EARLY THRUST SUE SPORTS MEAT BIG

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding synonymous nouns among the given words. 

1. **SUBSTANCE**: This can be a noun meaning "material" or "essence."
2. **WIRELESS**: This is typically an adjective, but as a noun, it could refer to "radio" or "Wi-Fi."
3. **DEMI**: This is often used as a prefix, but as a noun, it could refer to "demigod" or "half."
4. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun meaning a type of "exercise."
5. **CORE**: This can be a noun meaning "center" or "essence."
6. **LADY**: This is a noun meaning "woman."
7. **EARLY**: This is typically an adjective, but as a noun, it could refer to "beginning" or "dawn."
8. **THRUST**: This can be a noun meaning "push" or "drive."
9. **SUE**: This is typically a verb, but as a noun, it could refer to a "lawsuit."
10. **SPORTS**: This is a noun meaning "athletics" or "games."
11. **MEAT**: This can be a noun meaning "flesh" or "substance."
12. **BIG**: This is typically an adjective, but as a noun, it could refer to "big shot" or "big deal."

Now, let's try to find a group of four words that can be synonymous nouns:

- **SUBSTANCE** and **CORE**: Both can mean "essence."
- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can relate to "push" or "drive" in a physical sense.
- **MEAT** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can mean "material" or "essence."

Let's focus on the "essence" or "material" connection:

1. **SUBSTANCE**: Essence, material
2. **CORE**: Essence, center
3. **MEAT**: Substance, material
4. **THRUST**: Drive, push (a bit of a stretch, but can relate to the core idea of force or essence in a metaphorical sense)

This group might not be perfect, but it's a start. If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or combination. Let me know if you want to explore other possibilities or if you have any other ideas!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI SUE THRUST PUSH-UP LADY SUBSTANCE MEAT SPORTS WIRELESS BIG EARLY CORE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We need to find a group of four words from the list that can substitute for each other, functioning as the same part of speech. 

1. **Identify potential connections:**

   - **DEMI**: Often used as a prefix meaning "half" or "partial," but can also refer to a person (e.g., a demi-celebrity).
   - **SUE**: A verb meaning to initiate legal proceedings against someone.
   - **THRUST**: Can be a verb meaning to push with force or a noun referring to the main point or essence.
   - **PUSH-UP**: Typically a noun referring to an exercise, but can also be a verb phrase.
   - **LADY**: A noun meaning a woman.
   - **SUBSTANCE**: A noun meaning the physical material or essence of something.
   - **MEAT**: A noun referring to the flesh of an animal or the essential part of something.
   - **SPORTS**: A noun referring to physical activities or games.
   - **WIRELESS**: An adjective meaning without wires, often used in technology.
   - **BIG**: An adjective meaning large in size.
   - **EARLY**: An adjective or adverb meaning before the usual time.
   - **CORE**: A noun meaning the central or most important part of something.

2. **Look for potential pairs:**

   - **THRUST** and **CORE**: Both can refer to the main point or essence of something (noun).
   - **MEAT** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can refer to the essential part or essence of something (noun).

3. **Expand to four words:**

   - **THRUST**, **CORE**, **MEAT**, **SUBSTANCE**: All can be nouns referring to the essential part or main point of something.

4. **Verify the pattern:**

   - **THRUST**: The main point or essence.
   - **CORE**: The central or most important part.
   - **MEAT**: The essential part or substance.
   - **SUBSTANCE**: The essence or material of something.

These four words can substitute for each other when referring to the essential part or main point of something, fitting the pattern of being nouns with a similar meaning.

If this solution doesn't fit the intended pattern, we can explore other combinations or start over with a different approach. Let me know if you need further assistance!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CORE DEMI EARLY SUBSTANCE SPORTS WIRELESS PUSH-UP LADY THRUST MEAT BIG SUE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, following the pattern of finding words that connect to different meanings of the same word or letter.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **CORE**: 
   - Core can refer to the central part of something (like an apple core).
   - It can also refer to the central or most important part of something (like the core of a problem).

2. **THRUST**:
   - Thrust can mean to push something with force.
   - It can also refer to the main point or essence of an argument or discussion.

Both "core" and "thrust" can relate to the central or essential part of something, but they also have distinct meanings.

### Step 2: Find Other Words

3. **SUBSTANCE**:
   - Substance can mean the physical material from which something is made.
   - It can also refer to the essential nature or most important part of something (e.g., the substance of an argument).

4. **MEAT**:
   - Meat can refer to the flesh of an animal used as food.
   - It can also mean the main or most important part of something (e.g., the meat of the story).

### Group of Four Words

- **CORE**: Central part of something.
- **THRUST**: Main point or essence.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Essential nature or most important part.
- **MEAT**: Main or most important part.

These four words each connect to different meanings of the word "core" or "essence," focusing on the idea of the central or most important part of something.

If this doesn't seem to fit the pattern perfectly, we can try another combination or explore different meanings. Let me know if you want to explore further or if you have any other ideas!

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can follow each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words and phrases rather than generic and ubiquitous words and phrases.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “George”: BOY BY CURIOUS SAINT
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Valley”: DEATH HIDDEN SILICON UNCANNY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Crane”: CONSTRUCTION FRASIER PAPER WHOOPING
Puzzle words that are each followed by “up”: AMP FIRE HYPE PUMP
Puzzle words that are each followed by “jam”: NBA PAPER PEARL TRAFFIC
Puzzle words that are each followed by “bear”: BOO-BOO BROWN HONEY TEDDY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “chip”: BLUE COMPUTER POKER POTATO
Puzzle words that are each followed by “wheel”: CHEESE COLOR HAMSTER PRAYER

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same word or phrase that follows them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words and phrases are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same word or phrase. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CROP CURIOUS BAD TANK GEE FLY BEE FRESH TEE RAD EX JAY BOY POLO BY SAINT

Output:

To tackle this puzzle effectively, let's begin by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **CROP** - dust, circles, top, rotation
- **CURIOUS** - George, case, about, nature
- **BAD** - news, influence, boy, habit
- **TANK** - top, engine, battle, fish
- **GEE** - whiz, thanks, golly, willikers
- **FLY** - swatter, fishing, high, away
- **BEE** - hive, line, pollen, movie
- **FRESH** - air, produce, start, prince
- **TEE** - shirt, time, off, ball
- **RAD** - tech, radiation, cool, level
- **EX** - wife, husband, file, change
- **JAY** - bird, walk, Z, blue
- **BOY** - scout, friend, George, band
- **POLO** - shirt, match, water, club
- **BY** - pass, law, product, George
- **SAINT** - Bernard, Mary, George, Nicholas

### Observations:

Observing a connection here with the word "George", as it follows CURIOUS (from the character Curious George), BOY (from the character Boy George), SAINT (Saint George), and BY (like in a phrase, although a bit of a stretch). Here's a pattern match:

**Pattern:** Words that are each followed by “George”

- CURIOUS
- BOY
- SAINT
- BY

Now, let's test another set of puzzle words:

1. **BAD** - followed by "guy", "habit", "blood", etc.
2. **FRESH** - followed by "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
3. **TANK** - followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
4. **TEE** - followed by "shirt", "time", "off", etc.

No obvious connection stands out here as strongly as the previous one.

Let's try one more grouping:

1. **CROP** - followed by "top", "circle", "dusting", etc.
2. **TANK** - again, followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
3. **FRESH** - mentioned earlier, "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
4. **EX** - followed by "girlfriend", "president", "employee", etc.

Here, the words "CROP" and "TANK" both could follow with "top" (crop top, tank top). However, extending this to four words with the same following phrase doesn't work in this selection.

In conclusion, for this set, the strongest pattern match I found involves:

- **CURIOUS**
- **BOY**
- **SAINT**
- **BY**

All of these can logically be followed by the word "George".

— end of example input and output —


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI WIRELESS SPORTS THRUST PUSH-UP MEAT LADY EARLY SUE BIG SUBSTANCE CORE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **DEMI** - god, Moore, Lovato, glaze
- **WIRELESS** - network, technology, connection, charging
- **SPORTS** - car, team, center, news
- **THRUST** - vector, stage, bearing, force
- **PUSH-UP** - bra, exercise, challenge, position
- **MEAT** - loaf, market, grinder, pie
- **LADY** - bird, Gaga, luck, finger
- **EARLY** - bird, riser, adopter, morning
- **SUE** - storm, Grafton, Sylvester, me
- **BIG** - deal, bang, apple, time
- **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, matter, control
- **CORE** - strength, apple, values, group

### Observations:

Let's look for a common word or phrase that can follow four of these puzzle words.

1. **DEMI** - "Moore" and "Lovato" are specific names, but "glaze" is a type of sauce.
2. **WIRELESS** - "network" and "connection" are common, but "charging" is a specific technology.
3. **SPORTS** - "car" and "center" are common, but "news" is a specific type of media.
4. **THRUST** - "vector" and "force" are common, but "bearing" is a specific mechanical term.
5. **PUSH-UP** - "bra" and "exercise" are common, but "challenge" is a specific fitness term.
6. **MEAT** - "loaf" and "market" are common, but "grinder" is a specific kitchen tool.
7. **LADY** - "bird" and "Gaga" are specific names, but "luck" is a common phrase.
8. **EARLY** - "bird" and "riser" are common, but "adopter" is a specific term.
9. **SUE** - "storm" and "Grafton" are specific names, but "me" is a common phrase.
10. **BIG** - "deal" and "bang" are common, but "apple" is a specific city.
11. **SUBSTANCE** - "abuse" and "use" are common, but "control" is a specific term.
12. **CORE** - "strength" and "values" are common, but "group" is a specific term.

### Potential Pattern:

A potential pattern emerges with the word "bird":

- **LADY** - Ladybird (a type of beetle)
- **EARLY** - Early bird (a person who wakes up early)
- **BIG** - Big bird (a character from Sesame Street)
- **SPORTS** - Sports bird (not a common phrase, but "birdie" is a term in golf)

This pattern is not perfect, but it shows a potential connection. Let's try another grouping:

1. **DEMI** - "glaze" (a type of sauce)
2. **MEAT** - "pie" (a type of dish)
3. **BIG** - "deal" (a common phrase)
4. **CORE** - "strength" (a common fitness term)

This grouping doesn't form a strong pattern either. Let's try one more:

1. **WIRELESS** - "charging" (a technology)
2. **SPORTS** - "car" (a type of vehicle)
3. **THRUST** - "vector" (a physics term)
4. **PUSH-UP** - "bra" (a type of clothing)

This grouping doesn't form a strong pattern either.

### Conclusion:

The strongest pattern I found involves:

- **LADY**
- **EARLY**
- **BIG**
- **SPORTS**

All of these can logically be followed by the word "bird" in some contexts, although "sports bird" is a stretch. If this doesn't work, we may need to try another pattern or set of words.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are parts of the same thing or process

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SPORTS MEAT THRUST SUE EARLY DEMI WIRELESS CORE BIG SUBSTANCE LADY PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are parts of the same thing or process.

1. **SPORTS**: This could relate to various activities or categories, but let's keep it in mind for now.

2. **MEAT**: This could relate to food, cooking, or cuts of meat.

3. **THRUST**: This could relate to movement, force, or mechanics.

4. **SUE**: This could relate to legal processes.

5. **EARLY**: This could relate to time or stages.

6. **DEMI**: This could relate to size (half) or a prefix in various contexts.

7. **WIRELESS**: This could relate to technology or communication.

8. **CORE**: This could relate to the center or essential part of something.

9. **BIG**: This could relate to size or importance.

10. **SUBSTANCE**: This could relate to material or essence.

11. **LADY**: This could relate to gender or a title.

12. **PUSH-UP**: This could relate to exercise or movement.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**: These words could all relate to physical exercise or fitness. "Thrust" and "push-up" are movements, "core" is a part of the body often focused on in fitness, and "sports" is a general category that includes physical activities.

- **MEAT, SUBSTANCE, CORE, BIG**: These words could relate to food or cooking. "Meat" and "substance" are types of food, "core" could refer to the central part of a fruit or vegetable, and "big" could describe the size of a portion.

- **WIRELESS, CORE, SUBSTANCE, DEMI**: These words could relate to technology or communication. "Wireless" is a type of technology, "core" could refer to the central processing unit, "substance" could refer to the content or data, and "demi" could be a prefix used in technology terms.

The strongest connection seems to be the first group related to physical exercise or fitness:

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**

These words all relate to physical activities and exercises, which could be considered parts of the same process or category. Let's go with this group as our potential solution.
