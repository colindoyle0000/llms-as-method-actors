Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each relate to the same thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that each relate to the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words relate to the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each relate to “Happy New Year!”: BALL COUNTDOWN FIREWORKS KISS
Puzzle words that each refer to things you can do to your nose: BLOW HOLD PICK THUMB
Puzzle words that each relate to “Oomph”: ENERGY FIRE JUICE ZIP
Puzzle words that are things to blow on for wishes/luck: CANDLE DANDELION DICE EYELASH
Puzzle words that each relate to attraction: APPEAL CHARM DRAW PULL
Puzzle words that each relate to sound/hearing: ACOUSTIC AUDITORY HEARD SONIC
Puzzle words that each refer to things that are cinched in the middle: CORSET DIABOLO HOURGLASS WASP
Puzzle words that each refer to things you can set: MOOD RECORD TABLE VOLLEYBALL
Puzzle words that each relate to Italian demonyms: BOLOGNESE NEAPOLITAN PARMESAN VENETIAN
Puzzle words that each refer to spirals in nature: CYCLONE GALAXY SNAIL SUNFLOWER

Step 2: See if other puzzle words also relate to the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that each relate to the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that each relate to the same thing, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI LADY PAYDAY CORE BIG MARS CRUNCH EARLY WIRELESS SUE PUSH-UP THRUST SUBSTANCE DOVE SPORTS MEAT

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, looking for subtle connections between the words. We'll start by identifying two words that relate to the same thing and then see if we can find more words that fit the same pattern.

1. **DEMI and LADY**: Both words can relate to "titles" or "roles." "Demi" can refer to a "demigod" or "demigoddess," and "Lady" is a title of nobility.

2. **PAYDAY and EARLY**: These words can relate to "time." "Payday" is a specific time when you receive payment, and "early" refers to a time before the expected or usual time.

3. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: Both words can relate to "essence" or "central part." "Core" is the central part of something, and "substance" refers to the essential nature or most important part of something.

4. **BIG and MARS**: These words can relate to "planets." "Big" could refer to the size of planets, and "Mars" is a specific planet.

5. **CRUNCH and THRUST**: Both words can relate to "force" or "pressure." "Crunch" can refer to a situation requiring decisive action or pressure, and "thrust" is a forceful push.

6. **WIRELESS and PUSH-UP**: These words can relate to "technology" or "exercise." "Wireless" refers to technology without wires, and "push-up" is a type of exercise.

7. **SUE and DOVE**: Both words can relate to "peace." "Sue" can mean to seek peace or reconciliation, and "dove" is a symbol of peace.

8. **SPORTS and MEAT**: These words can relate to "physical activity" or "nutrition." "Sports" involve physical activity, and "meat" is a source of nutrition.

Now, let's see if we can find a group of four words that relate to the same thing:

- **CORE, SUBSTANCE, CRUNCH, THRUST**: These words can all relate to "force" or "pressure." "Core" and "substance" refer to the essential part, while "crunch" and "thrust" involve applying force or pressure.

This group seems to fit a pattern related to "force" or "pressure." If this doesn't seem correct, we can try another pattern or explore other connections. Let me know if you want to explore further or if you have any other ideas!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words are each a type of the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each a type of name prefix: GEN MS PROF REV
Puzzle words that are each a type of road name: ALLEY DRIVE LANE STREET
Puzzle words that are each a type of interval of time: PERIOD SPELL STRETCH WHILE
Puzzle words that are each a type of farm tool: HOE PLOW RAKE SICKLE
Puzzle words that are each a type of sports venue: ARENA BOWL DOME FIELD

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: EARLY MEAT BIG PUSH-UP DOVE THRUST SPORTS SUE LADY CRUNCH PAYDAY CORE WIRELESS DEMI MARS SUBSTANCE

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential connections between the words. We'll start by looking for two words that are each a type of the same thing, and then see if we can expand that to a group of four.

1. **EARLY**: Could refer to time or something that happens before others.
2. **MEAT**: A type of food.
3. **BIG**: A descriptor for size.
4. **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise.
5. **DOVE**: A type of bird or a symbol of peace.
6. **THRUST**: Could refer to a force or movement.
7. **SPORTS**: Activities involving physical exertion and skill.
8. **SUE**: To take legal action.
9. **LADY**: A term for a woman.
10. **CRUNCH**: Could refer to a sound or a type of exercise.
11. **PAYDAY**: A day when one receives payment.
12. **CORE**: Could refer to the central part of something or a type of exercise.
13. **WIRELESS**: Refers to technology without wires.
14. **DEMI**: A prefix meaning half.
15. **MARS**: A planet or a Roman god.
16. **SUBSTANCE**: A type of material or matter.

Now, let's look for connections:

- **PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE**: These are all types of exercises, specifically targeting the upper body or core.
- **DOVE, MARS**: These could be types of symbols or names (Dove as a symbol of peace, Mars as a symbol of war or a planet).
- **MEAT, SUBSTANCE**: Both could be types of materials, though this is a bit broad.
- **WIRELESS, DEMI**: These are prefixes, but they don't match the pattern of four.

Let's focus on the exercise connection:

1. **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise.
2. **CRUNCH**: A type of exercise.
3. **CORE**: Often refers to exercises targeting the core muscles.
4. **THRUST**: Could be a type of movement in exercises, though less specific.

This seems like a plausible group, as they all relate to exercises or movements. Let's go with this:

**PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE, THRUST**: Each a type of exercise or movement.

If this doesn't fit the pattern, we can try another approach. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each come after the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can come before each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each come after “SECRET”: AGENT CODE SANTA SAUCE
Puzzle words that each come after “FUNNY”: BONE BUSINESS GIRL PAGES
Puzzle words that each come after “SILVER”: FOX LINING SCREEN SPOON
Puzzle words that each come after “STICKY”: FINGERS NOTE RICE WICKET
Puzzle words that each come after “SECOND”: FIDDLE GUESS NATURE WIND
Puzzle words that each come after “PLAY”: DATE DEAD DIRTY DOH
Puzzle words that each come after “CAT’S” : CRADLE EYE MEOW PAJAMAS
Puzzle words that each come after “SPACE”: BAR CADET HEATER STATION
Puzzle words that each come after “LIVING”: LARGE LEGEND PROOF ROOM
Puzzle words that each come after “HEAD OF”: HAIR LETTUCE STATE STEAM

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can have the same word come before them.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same word come before them, trying to arrive at a group of four words that can each have the same word come before them. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BABY SEGMENT DEAR SANTA LINE FIRE POINT BOO RAY JUICE ENERGY AGENT ZIP LOVE CODE SAUCE

Output:

Let’s examine the list of puzzle words provided to see what words come before these words, then identify puzzle words from the list that have the same words that commonly come before them, then identify what other puzzle words could form this connection, then arrive at a conclusion.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**BABY** - newborn, my, little, sweet

**SEGMENT** - market, audience

**DEAR** - my, oh

**SANTA** - dear, secret

**LINE** - front, base, guide, head, through

## Output

Let's go through the steps to find a possible solution to this puzzle.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**CRUNCH** - number, credit, time, ab

**MEAT** - red, white, ground, deli

**PUSH-UP** - exercise, bra, challenge

**DEMI** - moore, lovato, god, glaze

Let's identify any common words that can come before multiple puzzle words:

- **BIG**: CRUNCH, PAYDAY
- **WHITE**: MEAT, DOVE
- **APPLE**: CORE, BIG
- **FIRST**: LADY, DEMI
- **NUMBER**: CRUNCH, ONE (not in list)
- **PEACE**: DOVE, TALKS (not in list)

**Step 3: What other puzzle words could have the same word come before them?**

Let's explore the possibilities:

- **BIG**: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, and potentially BIG LADY (as in a colloquial sense) or BIG SPORTS (as in big sports event)
- **WHITE**: MEAT, DOVE, and potentially WHITE WIRELESS (as in a brand or product name)
- **APPLE**: CORE, and potentially APPLE CRUNCH (as in a snack or dessert)
- **FIRST**: LADY, and potentially FIRST DEMI (as in a title or name)

**Step 4: Conclusion**

The most promising pattern seems to be with the word "BIG":

Words that each come after the word “BIG”: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, LADY, SPORTS

This is a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each share the same unique characteristic. For this pattern, the connection is with how the puzzle words are structured or how the words sound, not with what the words mean.

Steps to take:

Step 1: Say different puzzle words aloud and try to identify two puzzle words that share a unique characteristic related to how the word is structured or sounds. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular characteristics are more likely to be the correct connection than generic and ubiquitous characteristics. Think outside the box.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each heteronyms: BASS DOVE DESERT WIND
Puzzle words that are each letter spellings: BEE EX GEE JAY
Puzzle words that are each two letters + number: CANINE FREIGHT OFTEN STONE
Puzzle words that are each examples of onomatopoeia: BANG PLOP SPLASH THUD
Puzzle words that are each ”-ough” words that don’t rhyme: BOUGH COUGH DOUGH TOUGH
Puzzle words that are each words you say twice in a row: BOO POM TOM YO
Puzzle words that are each palindromes: BIB EYE GAG POP

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can have that same characteristic. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Try saying each puzzle word aloud to hear if the linguistic characteristic is present. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS SUE SUBSTANCE PAYDAY LADY MEAT CRUNCH PUSH-UP BIG THRUST CORE DOVE DEMI MARS EARLY SPORTS

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on the unique characteristics of the words. We'll say each word aloud and consider their structure and sound to identify any patterns.

1. **WIRELESS**
2. **SUE**
3. **SUBSTANCE**
4. **PAYDAY**
5. **LADY**
6. **MEAT**
7. **CRUNCH**
8. **PUSH-UP**
9. **BIG**
10. **THRUST**
11. **CORE**
12. **DOVE**
13. **DEMI**
14. **MARS**
15. **EARLY**
16. **SPORTS**

Let's start by considering some potential patterns:

### Step 1: Identify Unique Characteristics

- **Compound Words**: Words like "WIRELESS," "PAYDAY," "PUSH-UP," and "SPORTS" could be considered compound words, but "SPORTS" doesn't fit well here.
- **Homophones**: Words like "SUE" and "DOVE" could be homophones, but we need more words to fit this pattern.
- **Words with Double Letters**: "WIRELESS" has double 'S', but this doesn't seem to apply to others.
- **Words with Silent Letters**: "DOVE" could be pronounced differently, but this doesn't seem to apply to others.
- **Words with Two Syllables**: "WIRELESS," "PAYDAY," "LADY," "MEAT," "CRUNCH," "THRUST," "CORE," "DOVE," "DEMI," "MARS," "EARLY," "SPORTS" all have two syllables, but this is too common.

### Step 2: Test Potential Patterns

Let's focus on a more unique characteristic:

- **Words with a Repeated Sound or Letter**: 
  - "WIRELESS" (repeated 'S')
  - "PAYDAY" (repeated 'A')
  - "LADY" (repeated 'A')
  - "DEMI" (repeated 'E' sound)

This doesn't quite fit, so let's try another angle.

### Step 3: Consider Onomatopoeia or Sound Patterns

- **Onomatopoeia**: "CRUNCH" could be onomatopoeic, but others don't fit.
- **Rhyming or Similar Endings**: 
  - "PAYDAY," "LADY," "DEMI," "EARLY" all end with a 'Y' sound, but "DEMI" doesn't fit perfectly.

### Step 4: Try Another Pattern

Let's try focusing on words that could be related to a specific theme or category:

- **Words Related to Time or Events**:
  - "PAYDAY" (an event)
  - "EARLY" (related to time)
  - "SPORTS" (an event)
  - "MARS" (a time-related event, like Mars missions)

This doesn't seem to fit perfectly either.

### Conclusion

After considering various patterns, none of the combinations seem to fit a unique characteristic that stands out. Let's try another approach or pattern. If you have any other ideas or if we should try a different set of words, let me know!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are all within the same category

Steps to take:

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle categories are more likely to be the correct connection than simple and ubiquitous categories. Describe the category as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are all within the category of “places in France”: CHAMPAGNE DIJON NICE TOURS
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “black-and-white animals”: ORCA PANDA SKUNK ZEBRA
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “art mediums”: CHARCOAL INK PAINT PASTEL

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: EARLY BIG SPORTS PAYDAY MEAT DOVE THRUST MARS SUBSTANCE CRUNCH PUSH-UP SUE WIRELESS DEMI CORE LADY

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, as you suggested.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things.**

1. **EARLY and PAYDAY**: These could relate to time or events, but it's not a strong connection.
2. **BIG and DEMI**: These are both size-related, but they are opposites, so not quite a category.
3. **SPORTS and PUSH-UP**: These could relate to physical activities or fitness.
4. **MEAT and DOVE**: These could relate to food or animals, but not a strong connection.
5. **THRUST and CRUNCH**: These could relate to physical actions or exercises.
6. **MARS and LADY**: These could relate to names or titles, but not a strong connection.
7. **SUBSTANCE and CORE**: These could relate to material or essence.
8. **WIRELESS and SUE**: These don't seem to have a strong connection.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category.**

Let's explore the potential categories:

- **Physical Activities/Fitness**: SPORTS, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CRUNCH
  - This seems like a strong category. All these words can relate to exercises or physical activities.

- **Size/Measurement**: BIG, DEMI, CORE, EARLY
  - This is a weaker category, as the words don't fit perfectly.

- **Material/Essence**: SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, WIRELESS
  - This is a possible category, but WIRELESS doesn't fit well.

- **Names/Titles**: MARS, LADY, DEMI, SUE
  - This is a possible category, but it's not very strong.

The strongest category seems to be **Physical Activities/Fitness** with the words SPORTS, PUSH-UP, THRUST, and CRUNCH. These words all relate to exercises or physical activities, which fits the pattern of a unique, subtle category.

If this doesn't seem correct, we can try another pattern. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
