Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each connect to different meanings of the same word or letter.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that each connect to different meanings of the same word or letter. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how each of the two puzzle words connects to different meanings of the same word or letter.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each connected to different meanings of the word “delivered”: BABY BLOW PACKAGE SPEECH
Puzzle words that are each connected to different meanings of the word “stub”: CIGARETTE PENCIL TICKET TOE
Puzzle words that are each connected to different meanings of the word “mole”: ANIMAL BIRTHMARK SPY UNIT
Puzzle words that are each connected to different meanings of the word “slots”: ATM CASINO SCHEDULE SPATULA
Puzzle words that are each different meanings of the letter “I”: IODINE IOTA MYSELF ONE
Puzzle words that are each different meanings of the letter “K”: KELVIN OKAY POTASSIUM THOUSAND

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can connect to different meanings of the same word or letter. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that each connect to different meanings of the same word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that each connect to different meanings of the same word, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 The following guesses were incorrect:

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST CORE MEAT SPORTS PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE DEMI WIRELESS

## Output

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We need to find four words from the list that each connect to different meanings of the same word or letter. Let's start by examining each word and see if we can find any connections.

1. **THRUST**: 
   - Could relate to a forceful push or shove.
   - Could also refer to the main point or essence of an argument.

2. **CORE**:
   - Could refer to the central part of something, like an apple core.
   - Could also mean the most essential or important part of something.

3. **MEAT**:
   - Could refer to the flesh of an animal used as food.
   - Could also mean the main part or substance of something, like the "meat" of an argument.

4. **SPORTS**:
   - Could refer to physical activities or games.
   - Could also mean to wear or display something, as in "sporting a new hat."

5. **PUSH-UP**:
   - Could refer to the exercise.
   - Could also mean to increase or raise something, like "push up the volume."

6. **SUBSTANCE**:
   - Could refer to a particular kind of matter with uniform properties.
   - Could also mean the essence or most important part of something.

7. **DEMI**:
   - Could refer to something that is half or partial, like "demigod."
   - Could also be a prefix used in various contexts, like "demitasse."

8. **WIRELESS**:
   - Could refer to technology that operates without wires, like Wi-Fi.
   - Could also mean a radio or communication system that doesn't use wires.

Now, let's try to find a common word or letter that connects different meanings for four of these words:

- **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE** both connect to the idea of the "essence" or "main part" of something.
- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP** both connect to the idea of a "forceful movement" or "increase."

Let's see if we can find a word that connects these meanings:

- The word "ESSENCE" could connect CORE and SUBSTANCE.
- The word "FORCE" could connect THRUST and PUSH-UP.

However, we need four words that connect to different meanings of the same word. Let's try another approach:

- **CORE** (central part)
- **MEAT** (main part)
- **SUBSTANCE** (essence)
- **THRUST** (main point)

These could all connect to different meanings of the word "ESSENCE" or "MAIN PART."

Let's see if this fits the pattern:

- CORE: Central part of something.
- MEAT: Main part or substance of something.
- SUBSTANCE: Essence or most important part.
- THRUST: Main point or essence of an argument.

This seems to fit the pattern of different meanings of the word "ESSENCE" or "MAIN PART." Let's go with this combination:

CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE, THRUST

If this doesn't work, we can try another approach. Let me know if you want to explore other possibilities!

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can follow each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words and phrases rather than generic and ubiquitous words and phrases.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “George”: BOY BY CURIOUS SAINT
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Valley”: DEATH HIDDEN SILICON UNCANNY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Crane”: CONSTRUCTION FRASIER PAPER WHOOPING
Puzzle words that are each followed by “up”: AMP FIRE HYPE PUMP
Puzzle words that are each followed by “jam”: NBA PAPER PEARL TRAFFIC
Puzzle words that are each followed by “bear”: BOO-BOO BROWN HONEY TEDDY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “chip”: BLUE COMPUTER POKER POTATO
Puzzle words that are each followed by “wheel”: CHEESE COLOR HAMSTER PRAYER

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same word or phrase that follows them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words and phrases are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same word or phrase. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CROP CURIOUS BAD TANK GEE FLY BEE FRESH TEE RAD EX JAY BOY POLO BY SAINT

Output:

To tackle this puzzle effectively, let's begin by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **CROP** - dust, circles, top, rotation
- **CURIOUS** - George, case, about, nature
- **BAD** - news, influence, boy, habit
- **TANK** - top, engine, battle, fish
- **GEE** - whiz, thanks, golly, willikers
- **FLY** - swatter, fishing, high, away
- **BEE** - hive, line, pollen, movie
- **FRESH** - air, produce, start, prince
- **TEE** - shirt, time, off, ball
- **RAD** - tech, radiation, cool, level
- **EX** - wife, husband, file, change
- **JAY** - bird, walk, Z, blue
- **BOY** - scout, friend, George, band
- **POLO** - shirt, match, water, club
- **BY** - pass, law, product, George
- **SAINT** - Bernard, Mary, George, Nicholas

### Observations:

Observing a connection here with the word "George", as it follows CURIOUS (from the character Curious George), BOY (from the character Boy George), SAINT (Saint George), and BY (like in a phrase, although a bit of a stretch). Here's a pattern match:

**Pattern:** Words that are each followed by “George”

- CURIOUS
- BOY
- SAINT
- BY

Now, let's test another set of puzzle words:

1. **BAD** - followed by "guy", "habit", "blood", etc.
2. **FRESH** - followed by "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
3. **TANK** - followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
4. **TEE** - followed by "shirt", "time", "off", etc.

No obvious connection stands out here as strongly as the previous one.

Let's try one more grouping:

1. **CROP** - followed by "top", "circle", "dusting", etc.
2. **TANK** - again, followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
3. **FRESH** - mentioned earlier, "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
4. **EX** - followed by "girlfriend", "president", "employee", etc.

Here, the words "CROP" and "TANK" both could follow with "top" (crop top, tank top). However, extending this to four words with the same following phrase doesn't work in this selection.

In conclusion, for this set, the strongest pattern match I found involves:

- **CURIOUS**
- **BOY**
- **SAINT**
- **BY**

All of these can logically be followed by the word "George".

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI MEAT SPORTS WIRELESS CORE PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE THRUST

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **DEMI** - god, Moore, lovato, tasse
- **MEAT** - loaf, ball, market, grinder
- **SPORTS** - car, center, bar, team
- **WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, router
- **CORE** - strength, apple, group, values
- **PUSH-UP** - bra, challenge, exercise, bar
- **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, matter, control
- **THRUST** - vector, force, stage, bearing

### Observations:

Let's look for a common word or phrase that can follow four of these puzzle words.

1. **DEMI** - "god" is a strong candidate (demigod).
2. **MEAT** - "loaf" or "ball" are common (meatloaf, meatball).
3. **SPORTS** - "car" or "bar" are common (sports car, sports bar).
4. **WIRELESS** - "network" or "router" are common (wireless network, wireless router).
5. **CORE** - "strength" or "values" are common (core strength, core values).
6. **PUSH-UP** - "bra" or "challenge" are common (push-up bra, push-up challenge).
7. **SUBSTANCE** - "abuse" or "control" are common (substance abuse, substance control).
8. **THRUST** - "vector" or "force" are common (thrust vector, thrust force).

### Potential Matches:

- **DEMI** - "god" (demigod)
- **CORE** - "strength" (core strength)
- **SUBSTANCE** - "abuse" (substance abuse)
- **THRUST** - "force" (thrust force)

Unfortunately, these don't share a common word or phrase that follows all four. Let's try another approach:

- **DEMI** - "tasse" (demitasse)
- **MEAT** - "ball" (meatball)
- **SPORTS** - "bar" (sports bar)
- **WIRELESS** - "network" (wireless network)

Again, no commonality among four words. Let's try one more grouping:

- **DEMI** - "god" (demigod)
- **MEAT** - "market" (meat market)
- **SPORTS** - "car" (sports car)
- **WIRELESS** - "technology" (wireless technology)

No clear pattern emerges here either. 

### Conclusion:

For this set, I haven't found a strong pattern match involving four words that can logically be followed by the same word or phrase. We might need to consider a different pattern or set of words. If you have any other ideas or need further assistance, let me know!

Pattern: Puzzle words that are parts of the same thing or process

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the puzzle words are parts of the same thing or process.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE SPORTS WIRELESS PUSH-UP DEMI MEAT CORE THRUST

## Output

Let's break down the puzzle words and see if we can find a connection between them that fits the pattern of being parts of the same thing or process.

1. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to a material or matter, but it's quite broad.
2. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games, but it's also broad.
3. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to technology that operates without wires, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
4. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.
5. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning "half" or "partial," often used in terms like "demigod" or "demitasse."
6. **MEAT**: This refers to animal flesh used as food.
7. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something, like the core of an apple or the core muscles in the body.
8. **THRUST**: This refers to a forceful push or drive, often used in contexts like engines or physical movements.

Let's try to find connections:

- **CORE** and **THRUST**: These could be related to physical exercise or movements, as core exercises often involve thrusting motions.
- **PUSH-UP**: This is directly related to exercise, specifically targeting the core and upper body.
- **WIRELESS**: This could be a stretch, but if we think of wireless technology in terms of fitness, it could relate to wireless fitness trackers or devices used during exercise.

Let's see if we can find a group of four words that fit a specific theme:

1. **CORE**, **PUSH-UP**, **THRUST**, **WIRELESS**: These could all relate to a modern fitness routine or gym setting. Core exercises, push-ups, and thrusts are common exercises, and wireless technology is often used in fitness tracking.

This is a bit of a stretch, but it could be a possible connection. If this doesn't work, we might need to consider a different pattern or set of connections. Let me know if you want to explore another angle or if you have any other ideas!

"""

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: PUSH-UP DEMI WIRELESS CORE SUBSTANCE MEAT SPORTS THRUST

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step. We need to find four words from the list that can be synonymous verbs. 

1. **Identify potential verbs:**
   - PUSH-UP: This is typically a noun referring to an exercise, but "push" can be a verb.
   - DEMI: This is usually an adjective meaning "half" or "partial," not a verb.
   - WIRELESS: This is typically an adjective or noun, not a verb.
   - CORE: This can be a verb meaning "to remove the core from something," like an apple.
   - SUBSTANCE: This is typically a noun, not a verb.
   - MEAT: This is typically a noun, not a verb.
   - SPORTS: This is typically a noun, but "sport" can be a verb meaning "to wear or display."
   - THRUST: This can be a verb meaning "to push or drive with force."

2. **Identify potential synonyms:**
   - PUSH (from PUSH-UP) and THRUST are synonymous verbs meaning "to apply force."
   - CORE doesn't seem to have a direct synonym among the other words.
   - SPORT (from SPORTS) doesn't seem to have a direct synonym among the other words.

3. **Re-evaluate and try different combinations:**
   - Let's focus on PUSH and THRUST as a starting point. We need two more words that can be synonymous verbs with these.
   - Consider other meanings or less common uses of the words:
     - WIRELESS: Could it be used as a verb in a specific context? Not typically.
     - SUBSTANCE: Could it be used as a verb in a specific context? Not typically.
     - MEAT: Could it be used as a verb in a specific context? Not typically.
     - DEMI: Could it be used as a verb in a specific context? Not typically.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - It seems challenging to find four words that fit the pattern of synonymous verbs from this list. PUSH and THRUST are a pair, but we need two more words to complete the set.

Since we can't find a complete set of four synonymous verbs, we might need to consider a different pattern or re-evaluate the list for other potential verb meanings. Let me know if you want to try a different approach or if there are any other words to consider.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each homophones

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm potential homophones.

Step 2: Narrow down the list to only include puzzle words that are homophones.

Step 3: From the list of puzzle words that are homophones, try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that each have a common connection. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. 

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each homophones of names of animals: DEAR HAIR HOARSE WAIL
Puzzle words that are each homophones of Greek Letters: MOO NEW PIE ROW

If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over.

Example Input and Output:

Input:

Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: ANGEL, PIRATE, SPELL, WAIL, WITCH, HIVE, COMB,  WAX, DEAR, HAIR, HONEY,  HOARSE, PERIOD, STRETCH, WHILE, CLOWN

Output:

Let’s examine the list of words provided to see which ones are homophones, then narrow down the list to actual homophones, and then see if any are homophones based on a similar connection:

**Step 1: Identify Homophones**

For each word in the list, let’s say the word aloud to find out if it is a homophone

Angel - No homophone comes to mind

Pirate - No homophone comes to mind

Spell - No homophone comes to mind

Wail - Possible homophone “whale” like the sea animal

Witch - Possible homophone “which”

Hive - Possible homophone “I’ve”

Comb - Maybe a homphone of “come”

Wax - No homophone comes to mind

Dear - Possible homophone “deer”

Hair - Possible homophone “hare” or “here” or “hear”

Honey - No homophone comes to mind

Hoarse - Possible homophone “horse”

Period - No homophone comes to mind

Stretch - No homophone comes to mind

While - Possible homophone “wile” or “wild”

Clown - No homophone comes to mind

**Step 2: Narrow down list**

Wail - Possible homophone “whale” like the sea animal

Hive - Possible homophone “I’ve”

Comb - Maybe a homphone of “come”

Dear - Possible homophone “deer”

Hair - Possible homophone “hare” or “here” or “hear”

Hoarse - Possible homophone “horse”

While - Possible homophone “wile” or “wild”

**Step 3: Extract connection from list**

There does appear to be a common set of homophones here. The connection is “animal homophones” and the words are:

WAIL, DEAR, HAIR, HOARSE

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS MEAT CORE DEMI THRUST SUBSTANCE PUSH-UP SPORTS

## Output

Let's go through the list of words and identify potential homophones. Then, we'll narrow down the list to actual homophones and see if any group of four words shares a common connection.

**Step 1: Identify Homophones**

1. Wireless - No homophone comes to mind.
2. Meat - Possible homophone "meet."
3. Core - Possible homophone "corps."
4. Demi - No homophone comes to mind.
5. Thrust - No homophone comes to mind.
6. Substance - No homophone comes to mind.
7. Push-up - No homophone comes to mind.
8. Sports - No homophone comes to mind.

**Step 2: Narrow down list**

From the list, the potential homophones are:

- Meat - "meet"
- Core - "corps"

**Step 3: Extract connection from list**

Unfortunately, we only have two words that are potential homophones, and we need a group of four. Let's try to think of other possible homophones or connections:

- Meat ("meet") and Core ("corps") could be part of a theme related to gatherings or groups, but we need more words to fit this pattern.

Since we don't have enough words to form a group of four with a common connection, it seems this set of words might not contain the solution. We may need to consider a different pattern or list of words. If you have another list or pattern in mind, please share it, and we can try again.
