## Prompts

system: ""”

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.


 
 You should not copy from the notes any guesses that we already know were incorrect. 
 

Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, looking for subtle connections between the words. We'll start by identifying two words that relate to the same thing and then see if we can find more words that fit the same pattern.

1. **DEMI and LADY**: Both words can relate to "titles" or "roles." "Demi" can refer to a "demigod" or "demigoddess," and "Lady" is a title of nobility.

2. **PAYDAY and EARLY**: These words can relate to "time." "Payday" is a specific time when you receive payment, and "early" refers to a time before the expected or usual time.

3. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: Both words can relate to "essence" or "central part." "Core" is the central part of something, and "substance" refers to the essential nature or most important part of something.

4. **BIG and MARS**: These words can relate to "planets." "Big" could refer to the size of planets, and "Mars" is a specific planet.

5. **CRUNCH and THRUST**: Both words can relate to "force" or "pressure." "Crunch" can refer to a situation requiring decisive action or pressure, and "thrust" is a forceful push.

6. **WIRELESS and PUSH-UP**: These words can relate to "technology" or "exercise." "Wireless" refers to technology without wires, and "push-up" is a type of exercise.

7. **SUE and DOVE**: Both words can relate to "peace." "Sue" can mean to seek peace or reconciliation, and "dove" is a symbol of peace.

8. **SPORTS and MEAT**: These words can relate to "physical activity" or "nutrition." "Sports" involve physical activity, and "meat" is a source of nutrition.

Now, let's see if we can find a group of four words that relate to the same thing:

- **CORE, SUBSTANCE, CRUNCH, THRUST**: These words can all relate to "force" or "pressure." "Core" and "substance" refer to the essential part, while "crunch" and "thrust" involve applying force or pressure.

This group seems to fit a pattern related to "force" or "pressure." If this doesn't seem correct, we can try another pattern or explore other connections. Let me know if you want to explore further or if you have any other ideas!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential connections between the words. We'll start by looking for two words that are each a type of the same thing, and then see if we can expand that to a group of four.

1. **EARLY**: Could refer to time or something that happens before others.
2. **MEAT**: A type of food.
3. **BIG**: A descriptor for size.
4. **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise.
5. **DOVE**: A type of bird or a symbol of peace.
6. **THRUST**: Could refer to a force or movement.
7. **SPORTS**: Activities involving physical exertion and skill.
8. **SUE**: To take legal action.
9. **LADY**: A term for a woman.
10. **CRUNCH**: Could refer to a sound or a type of exercise.
11. **PAYDAY**: A day when one receives payment.
12. **CORE**: Could refer to the central part of something or a type of exercise.
13. **WIRELESS**: Refers to technology without wires.
14. **DEMI**: A prefix meaning half.
15. **MARS**: A planet or a Roman god.
16. **SUBSTANCE**: A type of material or matter.

Now, let's look for connections:

- **PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE**: These are all types of exercises, specifically targeting the upper body or core.
- **DOVE, MARS**: These could be types of symbols or names (Dove as a symbol of peace, Mars as a symbol of war or a planet).
- **MEAT, SUBSTANCE**: Both could be types of materials, though this is a bit broad.
- **WIRELESS, DEMI**: These are prefixes, but they don't match the pattern of four.

Let's focus on the exercise connection:

1. **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise.
2. **CRUNCH**: A type of exercise.
3. **CORE**: Often refers to exercises targeting the core muscles.
4. **THRUST**: Could be a type of movement in exercises, though less specific.

This seems like a plausible group, as they all relate to exercises or movements. Let's go with this:

**PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE, THRUST**: Each a type of exercise or movement.

If this doesn't fit the pattern, we can try another approach. Let me know if you need further assistance!

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's go through the steps to find a possible solution to this puzzle.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**CRUNCH** - number, credit, time, ab

**MEAT** - red, white, ground, deli

**PUSH-UP** - exercise, bra, challenge

**DEMI** - moore, lovato, god, glaze

**THRUST** - power, main, forward

**WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology

**CORE** - apple, hard, inner, nuclear

**SPORTS** - car, news, center, drink

**SUBSTANCE** - abuse, chemical, control

**MARS** - planet, bar, rover, mission

**LADY** - first, young, leading, my

**DOVE** - white, peace, mourning, chocolate

**BIG** - bang, deal, apple, brother

**PAYDAY** - loan, candy, advance

**SUE** - legal, court, file, law

**EARLY** - bird, morning, riser, adopter

**Step 2: Puzzle words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Let's identify any common words that can come before multiple puzzle words:

- **BIG**: CRUNCH, PAYDAY
- **WHITE**: MEAT, DOVE
- **APPLE**: CORE, BIG
- **FIRST**: LADY, DEMI
- **NUMBER**: CRUNCH, ONE (not in list)
- **PEACE**: DOVE, TALKS (not in list)

**Step 3: What other puzzle words could have the same word come before them?**

Let's explore the possibilities:

- **BIG**: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, and potentially BIG LADY (as in a colloquial sense) or BIG SPORTS (as in big sports event)
- **WHITE**: MEAT, DOVE, and potentially WHITE WIRELESS (as in a brand or product name)
- **APPLE**: CORE, and potentially APPLE CRUNCH (as in a snack or dessert)
- **FIRST**: LADY, and potentially FIRST DEMI (as in a title or name)

**Step 4: Conclusion**

The most promising pattern seems to be with the word "BIG":

Words that each come after the word “BIG”: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, LADY, SPORTS

This is a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern. Let me know if you need further assistance!

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on the unique characteristics of the words. We'll say each word aloud and consider their structure and sound to identify any patterns.

1. **WIRELESS**
2. **SUE**
3. **SUBSTANCE**
4. **PAYDAY**
5. **LADY**
6. **MEAT**
7. **CRUNCH**
8. **PUSH-UP**
9. **BIG**
10. **THRUST**
11. **CORE**
12. **DOVE**
13. **DEMI**
14. **MARS**
15. **EARLY**
16. **SPORTS**

Let's start by considering some potential patterns:

### Step 1: Identify Unique Characteristics

- **Compound Words**: Words like "WIRELESS," "PAYDAY," "PUSH-UP," and "SPORTS" could be considered compound words, but "SPORTS" doesn't fit well here.
- **Homophones**: Words like "SUE" and "DOVE" could be homophones, but we need more words to fit this pattern.
- **Words with Double Letters**: "WIRELESS" has double 'S', but this doesn't seem to apply to others.
- **Words with Silent Letters**: "DOVE" could be pronounced differently, but this doesn't seem to apply to others.
- **Words with Two Syllables**: "WIRELESS," "PAYDAY," "LADY," "MEAT," "CRUNCH," "THRUST," "CORE," "DOVE," "DEMI," "MARS," "EARLY," "SPORTS" all have two syllables, but this is too common.

### Step 2: Test Potential Patterns

Let's focus on a more unique characteristic:

- **Words with a Repeated Sound or Letter**: 
  - "WIRELESS" (repeated 'S')
  - "PAYDAY" (repeated 'A')
  - "LADY" (repeated 'A')
  - "DEMI" (repeated 'E' sound)

This doesn't quite fit, so let's try another angle.

### Step 3: Consider Onomatopoeia or Sound Patterns

- **Onomatopoeia**: "CRUNCH" could be onomatopoeic, but others don't fit.
- **Rhyming or Similar Endings**: 
  - "PAYDAY," "LADY," "DEMI," "EARLY" all end with a 'Y' sound, but "DEMI" doesn't fit perfectly.

### Step 4: Try Another Pattern

Let's try focusing on words that could be related to a specific theme or category:

- **Words Related to Time or Events**:
  - "PAYDAY" (an event)
  - "EARLY" (related to time)
  - "SPORTS" (an event)
  - "MARS" (a time-related event, like Mars missions)

This doesn't seem to fit perfectly either.

### Conclusion

After considering various patterns, none of the combinations seem to fit a unique characteristic that stands out. Let's try another approach or pattern. If you have any other ideas or if we should try a different set of words, let me know!

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, as you suggested.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things.**

1. **EARLY and PAYDAY**: These could relate to time or events, but it's not a strong connection.
2. **BIG and DEMI**: These are both size-related, but they are opposites, so not quite a category.
3. **SPORTS and PUSH-UP**: These could relate to physical activities or fitness.
4. **MEAT and DOVE**: These could relate to food or animals, but not a strong connection.
5. **THRUST and CRUNCH**: These could relate to physical actions or exercises.
6. **MARS and LADY**: These could relate to names or titles, but not a strong connection.
7. **SUBSTANCE and CORE**: These could relate to material or essence.
8. **WIRELESS and SUE**: These don't seem to have a strong connection.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category.**

Let's explore the potential categories:

- **Physical Activities/Fitness**: SPORTS, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CRUNCH
  - This seems like a strong category. All these words can relate to exercises or physical activities.

- **Size/Measurement**: BIG, DEMI, CORE, EARLY
  - This is a weaker category, as the words don't fit perfectly.

- **Material/Essence**: SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, WIRELESS
  - This is a possible category, but WIRELESS doesn't fit well.

- **Names/Titles**: MARS, LADY, DEMI, SUE
  - This is a possible category, but it's not very strong.

The strongest category seems to be **Physical Activities/Fitness** with the words SPORTS, PUSH-UP, THRUST, and CRUNCH. These words all relate to exercises or physical activities, which fits the pattern of a unique, subtle category.

If this doesn't seem correct, we can try another pattern. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

Your response should consist of each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
