system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential connections for the words provided and determine if any of the guesses are strong enough to submit.

1. **DEMI**, **LADY**, **BIG**, **EARLY**: The suggested connection is that these words can function as adjectives or descriptors that modify nouns. While this is true, the connection is quite generic and not unique enough to be a strong guess. Many words can serve as adjectives or modifiers, so this connection lacks the specificity typically required for a New York Times connections puzzle.

Let's explore other possible connections among the remaining words:

- **SUBSTANCE**, **MEAT**, **CORE**, **THRUST**: These words could potentially relate to the idea of "essence" or "central part." However, "THRUST" might not fit as cleanly into this category as the others.

- **THRUST**, **PUSH-UP**, **SPORTS**, **WIRELESS**: These words could relate to physical activities or exercises, but "WIRELESS" doesn't fit this category.

- **SUE**, **SPORTS**, **WIRELESS**, **PUSH-UP**: These words don't seem to form a coherent or specific connection.

- **DEMI**, **LADY**, **BIG**, **EARLY**: As previously discussed, this connection is too generic.

Given the analysis, none of the connections seem strong or specific enough to submit confidently. The connection involving adjectives or descriptors is too broad, and the other potential connections don't fit all four words cleanly.

**Decision:**
We should go back to brainstorming other possible connections. The current guesses lack the specificity and uniqueness required for a strong submission. Let's explore other potential connections or combinations of words that might reveal a more precise and unique relationship.
