Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can mean the same thing. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can mean the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can mean the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “how fast something is going”: CLIP PACE RATE SPEED
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to fail to attend”: CUT DITCH MISS SKIP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to become aware of”: DISCOVER FIND LEARN REALIZE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to apply pressure to”: CRUSH MASH PRESS SQUASH
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to chat informally”: GAB JAW YAK YAP
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “pretense”: AFFECT AIRS CHARADE FRONT
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “foolishness”: ABSURDITY FOLLY MADNESS NONSENSE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to move forward”: ADVANCE MARCH PROGRESS PUSH
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to get smaller”: CONTRACT LESSEN REDUCE SHRINK
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to criticize”: BLAST KNOCK SLAM TRASH

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also mean the same thing as the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can mean the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can mean the same thing, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE SPORTS DEMI WIRELESS PUSH-UP BIG LADY EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding four words that can mean the same thing and function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can mean the same thing.

1. **SUE** and **DEMI**: These don't seem to have a direct connection in meaning.
2. **SPORTS** and **WIRELESS**: No direct connection here either.
3. **PUSH-UP** and **BIG**: Again, no direct connection.
4. **LADY** and **EARLY**: No direct connection.

Let's try another approach by looking at each word individually and seeing if we can find synonyms among them:

- **SUE**: As a verb, it means to take legal action against someone.
- **SPORTS**: As a noun, it refers to physical activities or games.
- **DEMI**: As an adjective, it means half or partial.
- **WIRELESS**: As an adjective, it means without wires, often referring to technology.
- **PUSH-UP**: As a noun, it refers to a physical exercise.
- **BIG**: As an adjective, it means large in size.
- **LADY**: As a noun, it refers to a woman.
- **EARLY**: As an adjective or adverb, it means before the usual or expected time.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also mean the same thing.

Let's try to find a group of four words that can mean the same thing:

1. **BIG** and **LADY**: These don't connect directly.
2. **EARLY** and **WIRELESS**: No direct connection.
3. **SUE** and **PUSH-UP**: No direct connection.
4. **SPORTS** and **DEMI**: No direct connection.

Let's try another angle:

- **BIG** and **LADY**: If we consider "big" as "important" and "lady" as "a woman of importance," we might have a connection, but we need two more words.
- **EARLY** and **WIRELESS**: No connection.
- **SUE** and **PUSH-UP**: No connection.
- **SPORTS** and **DEMI**: No connection.

It seems like we're not finding a clear group of four words that can mean the same thing. Let's try another pattern or see if there's another angle we haven't considered. If you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern to try, let me know!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can each be a part of a different word within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories. As precisely as possible, describe how each of the two puzzle words can be part of a different word within the same category.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the first letters of a zodiac sign: CAN GEM LIB TAU
Puzzle words that are each the first letters of the name of a planet: EAR MAR MER SAT
Puzzle words that each start with letters that form the name of a rock band: CREAMSICLE JOURNEYMAN KISSCAM RUSHMORE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can be part of different words within that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE BIG LADY WIRELESS SPORTS PUSH-UP DEMI EARLY

## Output

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We need to find a category where each of these words can be a part of a different word within that category. Let's start by examining each word and see if we can identify any potential categories.

1. **SUE**: This could be part of "lawsuit" or "pursue." 
2. **BIG**: This could be part of "bigfoot" or "bigwig."
3. **LADY**: This could be part of "ladybug" or "landlady."
4. **WIRELESS**: This could be part of "wireless network" or "wireless charger."
5. **SPORTS**: This could be part of "sportswear" or "sportsmanship."
6. **PUSH-UP**: This could be part of "push-up bra" or "push-up exercise."
7. **DEMI**: This could be part of "demigod" or "demitasse."
8. **EARLY**: This could be part of "early bird" or "early riser."

Now, let's try to find a category that fits four of these words:

- **SUE** and **BIG** could both be part of legal terms: "lawsuit" and "bigwig" (a person of importance, often in legal or business contexts).
- **LADY** and **DEMI** could both be part of titles or roles: "landlady" and "demigod."

Let's see if we can find a more cohesive category:

- **WIRELESS** and **SPORTS** could both be part of technology or equipment: "wireless network" and "sportswear."
- **PUSH-UP** and **EARLY** could both be part of fitness or routines: "push-up exercise" and "early riser."

It seems like we're struggling to find a single category that fits four words perfectly. Let's try another approach:

- **SUE**, **BIG**, **LADY**, and **DEMI** could all be part of names or titles: "lawsuit," "bigwig," "landlady," and "demigod."

This seems like a plausible category. Let's go with names or titles as our category:

1. **SUE** - "lawsuit"
2. **BIG** - "bigwig"
3. **LADY** - "landlady"
4. **DEMI** - "demigod"

This is a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or category. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each modify the same word

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that each puzzle word can modify. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words rather than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each modify “pepper”: BELL BLACK DR GHOST
Puzzle words that each modify “trap”: BEAR SAND SPEED TOURIST
Puzzle words that each modify “hour”: AMATEUR ELEVENTH HAPPY RUSH
Puzzle words that each modify “dream”: AMERICAN FEVER LUCID PIPE
Puzzle words that each modify “bat”: BASEBALL CRICKET FRUIT VAMPIRE

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can each modify the same word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so a unique and particular word being modified is more likely to be correct than a generic and ubiquitous word.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can modify that same word. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each modify the same word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that each modify the same word, start over at Step 2.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS PUSH-UP DEMI EARLY BIG LADY SPORTS SUE

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step. We need to find a word that each of the puzzle words can modify. 

1. **WIRELESS**: This can modify "network" (wireless network), "headphones" (wireless headphones), "mouse" (wireless mouse), etc.

2. **PUSH-UP**: This can modify "bra" (push-up bra), "exercise" (push-up exercise), etc.

3. **DEMI**: This can modify "moore" (Demi Moore), "glace" (demi-glace), "god" (demigod), etc.

4. **EARLY**: This can modify "bird" (early bird), "morning" (early morning), "adopter" (early adopter), etc.

5. **BIG**: This can modify "deal" (big deal), "bang" (big bang), "apple" (Big Apple), etc.

6. **LADY**: This can modify "gaga" (Lady Gaga), "bug" (ladybug), "luck" (lady luck), etc.

7. **SPORTS**: This can modify "car" (sports car), "team" (sports team), "bar" (sports bar), etc.

8. **SUE**: This can modify "storm" (Sue Storm), "grafton" (Sue Grafton), "bird" (Sue Bird), etc.

Now, let's see if we can find a common word that four of these can modify:

- **EARLY** and **BIRD**: "Early bird"
- **BIG** and **BIRD**: "Big bird"
- **LADY** and **BIRD**: "Ladybird"
- **SUE** and **BIRD**: "Sue Bird"

It seems like "BIRD" is a word that can be modified by EARLY, BIG, LADY, and SUE. 

Therefore, the four words that match the pattern are: EARLY, BIG, LADY, and SUE, all modifying "BIRD". 

Let me know if you need further assistance or if you want to try another pattern!

Puzzle words that are each a kind of circular shape: BAND CIRCLE HOOP RING
Puzzle words that are each a kind of place to shop: MALL MARKET OUTLET STORE
Puzzle words that are each a kind of wrench: ALLEN CRESCENT MONKEY SOCKET

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by being a kind of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI SUE SPORTS BIG PUSH-UP LADY WIRELESS EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are each a kind of the same thing.

1. **DEMI**: This could refer to a type of bra (demi-cup), a type of person (demigod), or a type of size (demi-glace).

2. **SUE**: This could refer to a type of legal action (lawsuit), or it could be a name.

3. **SPORTS**: This could refer to a type of activity (sports), or a type of bra (sports bra).

4. **BIG**: This could refer to size, or it could be part of a name or title (e.g., Big Ben).

5. **PUSH-UP**: This could refer to a type of exercise, or a type of bra (push-up bra).

6. **LADY**: This could refer to a type of person (lady), or it could be part of a name or title (e.g., Lady Gaga).

7. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to a type of technology (wireless technology), or a type of bra (wireless bra).

8. **EARLY**: This could refer to time (early morning), or it could be part of a name or title.

Now, let's see if we can find a connection:

- **DEMI**, **SPORTS**, **PUSH-UP**, **WIRELESS**: These are all types of bras. 

This seems to be a plausible connection. Each of these words can describe a type of bra:

- **DEMI**: Demi-cup bra
- **SPORTS**: Sports bra
- **PUSH-UP**: Push-up bra
- **WIRELESS**: Wireless bra

This group of four words fits the pattern of being each a kind of the same thing. If this solution seems correct, we can proceed with it. If not, we can explore other potential connections.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous nouns.

Examples from prior puzzles:

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS DEMI BIG LADY SUE SPORTS EARLY PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential synonymous nouns among the given puzzle words: WIRELESS, DEMI, BIG, LADY, SUE, SPORTS, EARLY, PUSH-UP.

1. **WIRELESS**: As a noun, "wireless" can refer to a radio or a wireless communication device. However, it's not a common noun synonym with the other words at first glance.

2. **DEMI**: "Demi" is often used as a prefix meaning "half" or "partial," but as a standalone noun, it doesn't immediately suggest a synonym with the other words.

3. **BIG**: As a noun, "big" could refer to something large or significant, but it's more commonly used as an adjective.

4. **LADY**: As a noun, "lady" refers to a woman or a female of high social status. It could potentially be synonymous with other words that refer to women or titles.

5. **SUE**: As a noun, "sue" doesn't have a direct meaning, but as a verb, it means to take legal action. However, we're focusing on nouns.

6. **SPORTS**: As a noun, "sports" refers to physical activities or games. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym with the other words.

7. **EARLY**: As a noun, "early" could refer to an early time or period, but it's more commonly used as an adjective or adverb.

8. **PUSH-UP**: As a noun, "push-up" refers to a type of exercise. It doesn't immediately suggest a synonym with the other words.

Now, let's see if we can find any connections:

- **LADY**: This is the most promising word to start with, as it can be synonymous with other words referring to women or titles. Let's explore this further.

Possible synonyms for "LADY" could include:
- **DAME**: A title for a woman, especially in British English.
- **MISS**: A title for a young woman.
- **MA'AM**: A respectful term for a woman.

Unfortunately, none of the other words in the list directly match these synonyms. Let's try another approach:

- **SPORTS**: Could potentially be synonymous with activities or games. However, none of the other words fit this category.

- **EARLY**: Could be synonymous with beginnings or starts, but again, none of the other words fit this category.

Given the current list of words, it seems challenging to find a group of four that are synonymous nouns. We might need to consider a different pattern or set of words. If you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern to explore, let me know!
