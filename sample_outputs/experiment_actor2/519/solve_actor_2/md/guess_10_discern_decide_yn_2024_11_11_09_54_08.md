system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully evaluate the notes and the list of words to determine if we have a strong guess to submit.

1. **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**: This connection relates to physical fitness or exercise. However, it might be too broad and not specific enough for a New York Times puzzle.

2. **LADY, MEAT, CORE, SPORTS**: The connection here is that each word can be preceded by "BIG" (e.g., BIG LADY, BIG MEAT, BIG CORE, BIG SPORTS). This is a specific and unique connection, making it a strong candidate.

3. **SUE, BIG, MEAT, CORE**: The connection is that they are single-syllable words. This is too generic and unlikely to be correct.

4. **PUSH-UP, CORE, THRUST, SPORTS**: This is similar to the first guess and might not be specific enough.

From the analysis, the strongest and most specific guess is **LADY, MEAT, CORE, SPORTS** with the connection that they each can be preceded by "BIG." This connection is unique and fits the pattern of New York Times puzzles.

Given the options, I recommend submitting **LADY, MEAT, CORE, SPORTS** as the guess, as it is the most specific and likely to be correct based on the notes provided.
