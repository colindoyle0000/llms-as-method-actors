## Submitted Guesses Play-By-Play

### Guess 1

Incorrect: CRUNCH PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential connections:

1. **MEAT, MARS, EARLY, LADY, WIRELESS, DOVE, BIG, SUE, PUSH-UP, THRUST, PAYDAY, SPORTS, CRUNCH, CORE, DEMI, SUBSTANCE**

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that have a connection with each other.

- **MEAT** and **CORE**: Both can be related to the central part of something. "Meat" can refer to the central, substantial part of a fruit (like the meat of a coconut), and "core" is the central part of a fruit.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection.

- **SUBSTANCE**: This can also relate to the central or essential part of something, similar to "meat" and "core."
- **ESSENCE**: This word is not in the list, but if it were, it would fit this category. However, we need to find another word from the list.

Upon reviewing the list again, let's consider another potential connection:

- **BIG** and **DEMI**: These words can relate to size or portion. "Big" is large, and "Demi" means half or partial, often used in contexts like "demigod" or "demitasse."

Let's explore this further:

- **LADY**: This could relate to "Demi" as in "Demi Moore," a famous actress, but this is not a size-related connection.
- **SPORTS**: This doesn't fit the size or portion theme.
- **CRUNCH**: This doesn't fit the size or portion theme.
- **THRUST**: This doesn't fit the size or portion theme.
- **PAYDAY**: This doesn't fit the size or portion theme.
- **PUSH-UP**: This doesn't fit the size or portion theme.
- **WIRELESS**: This doesn't fit the size or portion theme.
- **SUE**: This doesn't fit the size or portion theme.
- **MARS**: This doesn't fit the size or portion theme.
- **EARLY**: This doesn't fit the size or portion theme.

Let's try another approach:

- **WIRELESS** and **CORE**: Both can relate to technology. "Wireless" is a type of technology, and "Core" can refer to the central processing unit in technology.

Let's see if other words fit this technology theme:

- **THRUST**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **PAYDAY**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **SPORTS**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **CRUNCH**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **PUSH-UP**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **SUE**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **MARS**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **EARLY**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **LADY**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **BIG**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **DEMI**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.
- **SUBSTANCE**: This doesn't fit the technology theme.

I am struggling to find a solid group of four words that share a specific connection. Let's try one more potential connection:

- **PUSH-UP** and **CRUNCH**: Both are exercises.

Let's see if other words fit this exercise theme:

- **THRUST**: This can be related to exercise as a movement.
- **SPORTS**: This is related to physical activity, which includes exercises.

This gives us a potential group: **PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, THRUST, SPORTS**.

I will submit this group as a guess: **PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, THRUST, SPORTS**.

### Guess 2

Incorrect: BIG DEMI EARLY LADY

Reasoning:
Let's go through the list of words and try to identify a connection between them.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that have a connection with each other.

- "BIG" and "DEMI" could be connected as prefixes that describe size or amount. "BIG" means large, and "DEMI" means half or partial.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection.

- "LADY" could fit as it is often used as a prefix in terms like "ladybug" or "ladybird."
- "WIRELESS" could fit as it is often used as a prefix in terms like "wireless network" or "wireless technology."

However, "WIRELESS" doesn't fit well with the prefix theme. Let's reconsider.

- "EARLY" could fit as it is often used as a prefix in terms like "early-bird" or "early-stage."

Let's see if we can find a better fit:

- "BIG" and "DEMI" are both prefixes.
- "LADY" is often used as a prefix.
- "EARLY" is often used as a prefix.

So, the connection could be "PREFIXES."

Let's submit the guess:

BIG DEMI LADY EARLY

This is my guess for one part of the solution to the puzzle.

### Guess 4

Incorrect: CORE DOVE MARS WIRELESS

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential connections:

1. **SUE**: This could relate to legal actions or names.
2. **SUBSTANCE**: This could relate to materials or something with physical presence.
3. **BIG**: This could relate to size or something significant.
4. **MEAT**: This could relate to food or types of protein.
5. **LADY**: This could relate to titles or names.
6. **PUSH-UP**: This could relate to exercises or actions.
7. **CRUNCH**: This could relate to sounds or exercises.
8. **THRUST**: This could relate to force or actions.
9. **SPORTS**: This could relate to activities or categories.
10. **DOVE**: This could relate to birds or names.
11. **WIRELESS**: This could relate to technology or communication.
12. **MARS**: This could relate to planets or names.
13. **CORE**: This could relate to central parts or exercises.
14. **DEMI**: This could relate to names or prefixes.
15. **PAYDAY**: This could relate to financial terms or events.
16. **EARLY**: This could relate to time or stages.

Now, let's identify potential connections:

- **PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, THRUST, CORE**: These words could relate to exercises or fitness terms. However, this guess was already incorrect.

- **BIG, DEMI, EARLY, LADY**: These words could relate to names or titles. However, this guess was already incorrect.

Let's explore other possibilities:

- **DOVE, MARS, WIRELESS, CORE**: These could relate to brands or products. For example, Dove (soap), Mars (candy), Wireless (technology), and Core (water brand).

- **SUE, DOVE, MARS, DEMI**: These could relate to names. Sue (a common name), Dove (a name), Mars (a name), Demi (a name).

- **SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, WIRELESS**: These could relate to something with physical presence or technology.

After considering these possibilities, I will make a guess:

**DOVE, MARS, WIRELESS, CORE**: These words could relate to brands or products. 

Let's submit this guess.

### Guess 5

Correct: CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential connections:

1. **BIG, DEMI, EARLY, LADY**: These words could be related to prefixes or descriptors, but this guess was already incorrect.

2. **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, THRUST**: These words could be related to physical activities or exercises, but this guess was already incorrect.

3. **CORE, DOVE, MARS, WIRELESS**: These words could be related to technology or brands, but this guess was already incorrect.

Let's explore other possibilities:

- **PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE, CRUNCH**: These are all names of candy bars. This seems like a strong connection.

- **BIG, LADY, DEMI, EARLY**: These could be descriptors or adjectives, but this was already an incorrect guess.

- **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, WIRELESS**: These words don't seem to form a clear connection.

- **THRUST, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH**: These words could relate to physical activities, but this was already an incorrect guess.

Based on the analysis, the strongest connection I can identify is:

**PAYDAY, MARS, DOVE, CRUNCH**: These are all names of candy bars.

I will submit this as the guess.

### Guess 6

Correct: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential connections:

1. **SUBSTANCE**: Could relate to material, essence, or a chemical.
2. **PUSH-UP**: An exercise or a type of bra.
3. **WIRELESS**: Relates to technology, communication without wires.
4. **BIG**: Size-related, could be a descriptor.
5. **EARLY**: Relates to time, something happening before expected.
6. **CORE**: Could relate to the center, essential part, or an exercise.
7. **THRUST**: Relates to force, movement, or propulsion.
8. **DEMI**: Could relate to half, a name, or a prefix.
9. **MEAT**: Food-related, could also be the essence of something.
10. **LADY**: A term for a woman, could relate to titles or names.
11. **SPORTS**: Relates to physical activities, games.
12. **SUE**: A name or legal action.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that have a connection with each other.

- **PUSH-UP** and **CORE**: Both relate to exercises, specifically targeting the core muscles.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection.

- **SPORTS**: This word can relate to physical activities, including exercises.
- **THRUST**: This could relate to a type of movement or force used in exercises, though it's a bit of a stretch.

Let's consider another potential connection:

- **WIRELESS** and **CORE**: Both can relate to technology (wireless technology, core technology).
- **SUBSTANCE**: Could relate to the core or essence of something, but this is less clear.
- **THRUST**: Could relate to core technology in terms of propulsion systems, but again, this is less clear.

Re-evaluating, let's try another angle:

- **DEMI** and **LADY**: Both can relate to names or titles.
- **SUE**: Also a name.
- **BIG**: Could relate to a name or title, but this is less clear.

Given the incorrect guess of BIG DEMI EARLY LADY, let's avoid those combinations.

Let's try another potential connection:

- **SUBSTANCE** and **MEAT**: Both relate to the essence or core of something.
- **CORE**: Directly relates to the essence or central part.
- **THRUST**: Could relate to the core concept of propulsion or force.

This seems like a plausible connection. Let's submit this guess:

**SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, THRUST**

### Guess 8

Correct: DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS WIRELESS

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential connections:

1. EARLY
2. LADY
3. BIG
4. WIRELESS
5. SPORTS
6. DEMI
7. SUE
8. PUSH-UP

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that have a connection with each other.

- "WIRELESS" and "SPORTS" could be connected through "types of bras" (WIRELESS BRA, SPORTS BRA).
- "PUSH-UP" also fits this category as "PUSH-UP BRA."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection.

- "DEMI" can also be connected to this category as "DEMI BRA."

Therefore, the connection is "TYPES OF BRAS": WIRELESS, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI.

I will submit the guess: WIRELESS, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI.

### Guess 2

Submitted and Incorrect: Guess: BIG DEMI EARLY LADY

Reasoning:
Let's go through the list of words and try to identify a connection between them.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that have a connection with each other.

- "BIG" and "DEMI" could be connected as prefixes that describe size or amount. "BIG" means large, and "DEMI" means half or partial.

This is my guess for one part of the solution to the puzzle.

### Guess 3

Guess: NO***GUESS***IDENTIFIED

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to find a connection among four of them.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that have a connection with each other.

- "DOVE" and "MARS" could be connected as they are both names of brands of chocolate. 

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection.

- "DOVE," "MARS," "LADY," and "BIG" could be connected as they are all names of brands or products. "DOVE" is a chocolate brand, "MARS" is a chocolate brand, "LADY" could refer to "Lady Godiva" chocolates, and "BIG" could refer to "Big Turk" or "Big Hunk" candy bars.

However, "BIG DEMI EARLY LADY" was an incorrect guess, so this connection is not valid.

Let's try another connection:

- "WIRELESS" and "PAYDAY" could be connected as they are both terms related to modern conveniences or technologies. "WIRELESS" refers to wireless technology, and "PAYDAY" could refer to payday loans or payday apps.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection.

- "WIRELESS," "PAYDAY," "SUBSTANCE," and "CORE" could be connected as they are all terms that can be associated with modern conveniences or technologies. "WIRELESS" refers to wireless technology, "PAYDAY" could refer to payday loans or apps, "SUBSTANCE" could refer to digital substance or content, and "CORE" could refer to the core of a technology or system.

This connection seems plausible, but let's consider other possibilities:

- "THRUST" and "CRUNCH" could be connected as they are both terms related to physical actions or exercises.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection.

- "THRUST," "CRUNCH," "PUSH-UP," and "SPORTS" could be connected as they are all terms related to physical exercises or sports activities.

However, "CRUNCH PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST" was an incorrect guess, so this connection is not valid.

Let's try another connection:

- "SUE" and "DEMI" could be connected as they are both names.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection.

- "SUE," "DEMI," "EARLY," and "LADY" could be connected as they are all names or titles. "SUE" is a name, "DEMI" is a name, "EARLY" could refer to a name or title, and "LADY" is a title.

However, "BIG DEMI EARLY LADY" was an incorrect guess, so this connection is not valid.

I can't identify a good guess to submit.

- **THRUST**: Could relate to the core concept of propulsion or force.

This seems like a plausible connection. Let's submit this guess:

**SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE, THRUST**

### Guess 7

Guess: NO GUESS IDENTIFIED NONE

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to find a potential connection among four of them.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that have a connection with each other.

- "SPORTS" and "WIRELESS" could be connected through the concept of "ESPN," which is a sports network that also offers wireless streaming services. However, this connection seems too specific and not likely to extend to four words.
- "PUSH-UP" and "SPORTS" could be connected through physical activities or exercises, but this connection is too broad and likely a red herring.
- "DEMI" and "LADY" could be connected through names of famous people (Demi Moore, Lady Gaga), but this is not a strong connection for four words.
- "BIG" and "LADY" could be connected through the concept of size or stature, but this is also too broad.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection.

- Let's consider "SUE" and "LADY." These could be connected through names or titles, but again, this is too broad.
- "WIRELESS" and "EARLY" could be connected through technology or innovation, but this is not a strong connection for four words.

Let's try a different approach:

- "BIG," "DEMI," "EARLY," and "LADY" were already guessed and found incorrect, so we need to avoid this combination.

Re-evaluating the words:

- "SPORTS," "WIRELESS," "PUSH-UP," and "SUE" don't seem to have a clear connection.

Let's focus on a different potential connection:

- "SPORTS" and "PUSH-UP" are related to physical activities.
- "WIRELESS" could be related to technology or modern conveniences.
- "SUE" could be related to legal actions.

None of these connections seem to form a group of four. Let's try another angle:

- "SPORTS" and "PUSH-UP" are related to fitness.
- "WIRELESS" could be related to modern technology.
- "EARLY" could be related to time.

I can't identify a good guess to submit. Let's try to find a more specific connection or start over with a fresh perspective.

### Guess 8

Submitted and Correct: Guess: DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS WIRELESS

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential connections:

1. EARLY
2. LADY
3. BIG
4. WIRELESS
5. SPORTS
6. DEMI
7. SUE
8. PUSH-UP

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that have a connection with each other.

- "WIRELESS" and "SPORTS" could be connected through "types of bras" (WIRELESS BRA, SPORTS BRA).
- "PUSH-UP" also fits this category as "PUSH-UP BRA."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection.

- "DEMI" can also be connected to this category as "DEMI BRA."

Therefore, the connection is "TYPES OF BRAS": WIRELESS, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI.

I will submit the guess: WIRELESS, SPORTS, PUSH-UP, DEMI.
