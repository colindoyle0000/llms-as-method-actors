## Submitted Guesses Play-By-Play

### Guess 1

Incorrect: DEMI DOVE LADY MARS

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential categories:

1. **EARLY, CORE, CRUNCH, PAYDAY**: These words can be associated with breakfast cereals. "Early" for early morning, "Core" for the core ingredient, "Crunch" for the texture, and "Payday" as a brand of cereal.

2. **DOVE, DEMI, LADY, MARS**: These words can be associated with chocolate brands. "Dove" is a chocolate brand, "Demi" could refer to "Demi-Sweet" chocolate, "Lady" could refer to "Lady Godiva" chocolates, and "Mars" is a well-known chocolate brand.

3. **BIG, MEAT, THRUST, SPORTS**: These words could be associated with something like "Big" for big game, "Meat" for meat sports, "Thrust" for a type of movement in sports, and "Sports" itself.

4. **SUE, WIRELESS, SUBSTANCE, PUSH-UP**: These words don't seem to fit together in an obvious category.

Based on the analysis, the most confident guess is:

**DOVE, DEMI, LADY, MARS**: These words are associated with chocolate brands.

I will submit this guess.

### Guess 2

Incorrect: CORE CRUNCH PUSH-UP SPORTS

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential connections:

1. **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**: These words are related to exercise or fitness. "Crunch" and "Push-up" are specific exercises, "Core" is a part of the body often targeted in workouts, and "Sports" is a general term for physical activities.

2. **MEAT, SUBSTANCE, BIG, EARLY**: These words don't seem to form a clear category.

3. **WIRELESS, PAYDAY, SUE, THRUST**: These words also don't seem to form a clear category.

4. **LADY, DOVE, MARS, DEMI**: This guess was already tried and was incorrect.

Given the analysis, the most confident guess is the first group related to exercise or fitness:

**CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**

I will submit this as a guess.

### Guess 3

Correct: CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential categories:

1. **DEMI, DOVE, LADY, MARS** - This guess was already incorrect, so we should avoid it.

2. **CORE, CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** - This guess was also incorrect, so we should avoid it.

3. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, CORE** - These words could relate to exercises or fitness terms, but since "CRUNCH" and "PUSH-UP" were part of an incorrect guess, this is not a viable category.

4. **SUE, PAYDAY, MEAT, BIG** - These words don't seem to form a clear category.

5. **SUBSTANCE, EARLY, WIRELESS, BIG** - These words don't seem to form a clear category.

6. **THRUST, DOVE, MARS, WIRELESS** - These words don't seem to form a clear category.

7. **DEMI, SUE, PAYDAY, EARLY** - These words could potentially relate to names or something else, but it's not clear.

8. **THRUST, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE** - These words could potentially relate to something scientific or physical, but it's not clear.

9. **WIRELESS, SPORTS, BIG, EARLY** - These words don't seem to form a clear category.

10. **DEMI, SUE, LADY, PAYDAY** - These words could potentially relate to names or something else, but it's not clear.

Given the analysis, let's consider a new potential category:

- **THRUST, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE**: These words could potentially relate to something scientific or physical, such as terms used in physics or biology.

I will submit the guess: **THRUST, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, CORE**.

### Guess 4

Incorrect: BIG CRUNCH PUSH-UP SPORTS

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential categories:

1. **BIG** - Could relate to size or something large.
2. **LADY** - Could relate to women or titles.
3. **SUE** - Could be a name or relate to legal action.
4. **PUSH-UP** - Could relate to exercises or fitness.
5. **CRUNCH** - Could relate to exercises or sounds.
6. **SPORTS** - Could relate to activities or games.
7. **EARLY** - Could relate to time or something that happens soon.
8. **DOVE** - Could relate to birds or peace.
9. **PAYDAY** - Could relate to finance or salary.
10. **DEMI** - Could relate to size or a name.
11. **WIRELESS** - Could relate to technology or communication.
12. **MARS** - Could relate to planets or mythology.

Let's try to identify a group of four words that share a specific category:

- **PUSH-UP** and **CRUNCH** both relate to exercises.
- **SPORTS** could also relate to exercises or physical activities.

Let's see if there's a fourth word that fits with exercises or physical activities:

- **EARLY** doesn't fit well with exercises.
- **WIRELESS** doesn't fit with exercises.
- **PAYDAY** doesn't fit with exercises.
- **BIG** could fit if we consider "big" as a descriptor for exercises, but it's not a strong fit.
- **SUE**, **LADY**, **DOVE**, **DEMI**, and **MARS** don't fit with exercises.

Given the options, the strongest connection seems to be with exercises:

- **PUSH-UP**
- **CRUNCH**
- **SPORTS**

We need a fourth word to complete this group. Since none of the remaining words fit perfectly, let's consider another potential category.

Let's consider another potential category:

- **BIG**, **LADY**, **SUE**, **DEMI** could relate to names or titles, but "DEMI" was part of an incorrect guess.

Let's try another approach:

- **WIRELESS** could relate to technology.
- **MARS** could relate to technology if we consider space exploration.
- **PAYDAY** doesn't fit with technology.
- **EARLY** could fit with technology if we consider early adopters or early technology.

Let's try a different approach:

- **BIG**, **LADY**, **SUE**, **DEMI** could relate to names or titles, but "DEMI" was part of an incorrect guess.

Given the constraints, let's try a different approach:

- **PUSH-UP**, **CRUNCH**, **SPORTS**, and **BIG** could relate to physical activities or exercises.

Let's submit this guess:

- **PUSH-UP**
- **CRUNCH**
- **SPORTS**
- **BIG**

This is the best guess based on the available words and the constraints provided.

### Guess 5

Incorrect: EARLY PAYDAY SUE WIRELESS

Reasoning:
Let's analyze the list of words to identify potential connections:

1. **DEMI, DOVE, LADY, MARS**: This guess was already tried and was incorrect.

2. **BIG, CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, SPORTS**: This guess was also tried and was incorrect.

3. **SUE, PAYDAY, EARLY, WIRELESS**: These words could potentially be connected through the theme of "MORNING" or "TIMING" (e.g., Early morning, Payday as a time, Wireless as in morning news, Sue as in morning routine).

4. **DEMI, MARS, BIG, EARLY**: These could be related to "CELEBRITIES" (Demi Moore, Bruno Mars, Big as in Big Sean, Early as in Early Grey).

5. **DOVE, PUSH-UP, WIRELESS, CRUNCH**: These could be related to "EXERCISES" or "FITNESS" (Dove as in a dive, Push-up as an exercise, Crunch as an exercise, Wireless as in wireless headphones used during exercise).

6. **LADY, SUE, PAYDAY, MARS**: These could be related to "MUSIC" (Lady Gaga, Sue as in a song title, Payday as a song, Mars as in Bruno Mars).

Given these analyses, the most promising guess that hasn't been tried yet is:

**SUE, PAYDAY, EARLY, WIRELESS**

This set seems to have a potential connection related to "MORNING" or "TIMING." Let's submit this guess.
