## Submitted Guesses Play-By-Play

### Guess 1

Incorrect: CORE CRUNCH PUSH-UP THRUST

Reasoning:
I can make a guess for one part of the solution. The words "PUSH-UP," "CRUNCH," "CORE," and "THRUST" can be grouped together under the category of "EXERCISES."

### Guess 2

Incorrect: BIG DEMI LADY SUE

Reasoning:
I can make a guess for one part of the solution. The words "DEMI," "BIG," "SUE," and "LADY" could be connected as they are all names of famous people or characters (Demi Moore, Big Sue, Lady Gaga). 

I will submit the guess: DEMI, BIG, SUE, LADY.

### Guess 3

Incorrect: CRUNCH MARS PAYDAY SUBSTANCE

Reasoning:
I will look for a group of four words that share a specific category. 

One potential category could be related to "Candy Bars" or "Chocolate Bars." The words that fit this category are:

- SUBSTANCE
- PAYDAY
- CRUNCH
- MARS

I will submit this guess: SUBSTANCE, PAYDAY, CRUNCH, MARS.

### Guess 5

Incorrect: BIG CRUNCH MARS PAYDAY

Reasoning:
I will make a guess based on the list of words provided. 

One potential category could be "Candy Bars," and the words that fit this category are:

I will submit this guess: MARS, PAYDAY, CRUNCH, BIG.

### Guess 4

Guess: NO GUESS IDENTIFIED NO

Reasoning:
I will look for a group of four words that share a specific category. 

One potential category could be "Candy Bars," which includes: PAYDAY, CRUNCH, MARS, and DOVE.

However, since the guess "CRUNCH MARS PAYDAY SUBSTANCE" was incorrect, I will avoid using those words together again.

Another potential category could be "Exercise Terms," which includes: CORE, CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, and THRUST.

However, since the guess "CORE CRUNCH PUSH-UP THRUST" was incorrect, I will avoid using those words together again.

Another potential category could be "Names," which includes: DEMI, SUE, LADY, and MARS.

However, since the guess "BIG DEMI LADY SUE" was incorrect, I will avoid using those words together again.

Given these considerations, I will look for another potential category:

A potential category could be "Early Morning Terms," which includes: EARLY, RISE, SHINE, and DAWN. However, none of these words are in the list.

I can't identify a good guess to submit.

### Guess 5

Submitted and Incorrect: Guess: BIG CRUNCH MARS PAYDAY

Reasoning:
I will make a guess based on the list of words provided. 

One potential category could be "Candy Bars," and the words that fit this category are: 

MARS, PAYDAY, CRUNCH, and BIG.

I will submit this guess: MARS, PAYDAY, CRUNCH, BIG.
