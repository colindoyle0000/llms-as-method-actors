## Prompts

You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Based on the analysis of the possible guesses from the notes, the strongest and most cohesive connection is the third one: **DEMI, WIRELESS, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** as types of bras. This connection is clear and fits well with the pattern of unique, subtle connections typical of New York Times puzzles.

Therefore, you should submit the guess **DEMI, WIRELESS, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** as an answer for this puzzle. This guess is strong and fits the criteria for a valid connection. 

Good luck, and I hope this helps in defusing the situation./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
