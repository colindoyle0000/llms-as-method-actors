Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each a kind of a thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. Describe the connection between the puzzle words as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each a kind of organization: CLUB GROUP PARTY TEAM
Puzzle words that are each a kind of shirt: CROP POLO TANK TEE
Puzzle words that are each a kind of bird: CARDINAL JAY LARK SWIFT
Puzzle words that are each a kind of transportation: BOAT CAR PLANE TRAIN
Puzzle words that are each a kind of cartoon mouse: ITCHY JERRY PINKY SPEEDY
Puzzle words that are each a kind of accessory: BELT BRACELET TIE WATCH
Puzzle words that are each a kind of container: BASKET BIN CHEST HAMPER
Puzzle words that are each a kind of circular shape: BAND CIRCLE HOOP RING
Puzzle words that are each a kind of place to shop: MALL MARKET OUTLET STORE
Puzzle words that are each a kind of wrench: ALLEN CRESCENT MONKEY SOCKET

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by being a kind of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SPORTS SUBSTANCE EARLY DOVE MARS SUE THRUST DEMI CRUNCH WIRELESS MEAT LADY PAYDAY CORE PUSH-UP BIG

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We'll look for subtle and unique connections that might not be immediately obvious.

1. **SPORTS** and **SUBSTANCE**: At first glance, these don't seem to share a direct connection. Let's move on and see if other words might connect.

2. **EARLY** and **DOVE**: "Early" could relate to time, and "Dove" could relate to a bird or a brand. Not a clear connection yet.

3. **MARS** and **SUE**: "Mars" is a planet, and "Sue" could be a name or a legal action. Again, not a clear connection.

4. **THRUST** and **DEMI**: "Thrust" could relate to force or movement, and "Demi" could relate to a name or a prefix meaning half. No clear connection.

5. **CRUNCH** and **WIRELESS**: "Crunch" could relate to sound or exercise, and "Wireless" relates to technology. No clear connection.

6. **MEAT** and **LADY**: "Meat" is a type of food, and "Lady" is a term for a woman. No clear connection.

7. **PAYDAY** and **CORE**: "Payday" relates to receiving payment, and "Core" could relate to the center of something. No clear connection.

8. **PUSH-UP** and **BIG**: "Push-up" is an exercise, and "Big" is a size descriptor. No clear connection.

Let's try to find a group of four words that might share a subtle connection:

- **SPORTS**, **THRUST**, **CRUNCH**, **PUSH-UP**: These could all relate to exercise or physical activity. "Sports" is a form of physical activity, "Thrust" can be a movement in sports, "Crunch" is an exercise, and "Push-up" is also an exercise.

This group seems to fit the pattern of being related to physical activity or exercise. Let's see if this connection holds:

- **SPORTS**: A form of physical activity.
- **THRUST**: A movement often used in sports or exercise.
- **CRUNCH**: A specific exercise targeting the abdominal muscles.
- **PUSH-UP**: A common exercise for upper body strength.

This group of four words seems to fit the pattern of being related to exercise or physical activity. If this is the intended connection, it could be a valid solution to the puzzle. If not, we may need to explore other potential connections. Let me know if you want to try another approach or if this seems like a plausible solution.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous nouns.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “scheme”: PLOT PLOY RUSE TRICK
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “swindler”: CHEAT CROOK QUACK SHARK
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “curmudgeon”: CRAB CRANK GROUCH GRUMP
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “boldness”: GALL GUTS NERVE STONES
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “brief moment”: FLASH JIFFY SECOND WINK

Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “sequence”: CHAIN SERIES STRING TRAIN
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “quarrel”: FIGHT ROW SCRAP TIFF
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “portion of profit”: CUT PIECE SHARE TAKE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SPORTS MARS THRUST SUBSTANCE WIRELESS MEAT EARLY CORE PAYDAY CRUNCH DEMI LADY SUE DOVE PUSH-UP BIG

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding four words that can be synonymous nouns. 

1. **Identify potential synonyms:**

   - **SPORTS**: Could be synonymous with "games" or "athletics."
   - **MARS**: Could be a noun referring to the planet or the Roman god of war.
   - **THRUST**: Could be synonymous with "force" or "drive."
   - **SUBSTANCE**: Could be synonymous with "material" or "essence."
   - **WIRELESS**: Could be synonymous with "radio" or "Wi-Fi."
   - **MEAT**: Could be synonymous with "flesh" or "protein."
   - **EARLY**: Could be synonymous with "beginning" or "dawn."
   - **CORE**: Could be synonymous with "center" or "essence."
   - **PAYDAY**: Could be synonymous with "salary" or "wages."
   - **CRUNCH**: Could be synonymous with "crisis" or "crackle."
   - **DEMI**: Could be synonymous with "half" or "partial."
   - **LADY**: Could be synonymous with "woman" or "dame."
   - **SUE**: Could be synonymous with "litigate" or "prosecute."
   - **DOVE**: Could be synonymous with "pigeon" or "peace."
   - **PUSH-UP**: Could be synonymous with "exercise" or "press-up."
   - **BIG**: Could be synonymous with "large" or "huge."

2. **Look for connections:**

   Let's focus on words that might have a more unique or specific synonym:

   - **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can mean "essence."
   - **THRUST** and **CRUNCH**: Both can imply "force" or "pressure."

3. **Expand to four words:**

   - **CORE**, **SUBSTANCE**, **THRUST**, **CRUNCH**: These words can be connected through the idea of "essence" or "force/pressure."

4. **Verify the connection:**

   - **CORE**: Can mean the central or most important part, synonymous with "essence."
   - **SUBSTANCE**: Can mean the essential nature or most important part, synonymous with "essence."
   - **THRUST**: Can mean the main point or essential part, synonymous with "essence" in a metaphorical sense.
   - **CRUNCH**: Can imply a critical point or pressure, which can be metaphorically linked to "essence" in terms of importance.

This group of words seems to fit the pattern of being synonymous nouns related to "essence" or "force/pressure." If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or set of words. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Pattern: Puzzle words that can substitute for each other. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can substitute for each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can substitute for each other.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to eat voraciously”: DOWN INHALE SCARF WOLF
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “universal”: BLANKET BROAD GENERAL SWEEPING
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “shared”: COLLECTIVE COMMON JOINT MUTUAL
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to rid of contents”: CLEAR DRAIN EMPTY FLUSH
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “method”: CHANNEL MEANS MEDIUM VEHICLE
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “unlikely (as a chance)”: OUTSIDE REMOTE SLIM SMALL

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to express indirectly”: COUCH IMPLY INTIMATE SUGGEST
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to wager”: BET GAMBLE RISK STAKE

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: EARLY MEAT SPORTS WIRELESS THRUST SUE CRUNCH SUBSTANCE LADY CORE BIG MARS PAYDAY PUSH-UP DOVE DEMI

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying words that can substitute for each other based on their meanings and parts of speech.

1. **Identify potential pairs:**
   - **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: Both can function as verbs meaning "to move something forward with force."
   - **CRUNCH and CRUNCH**: Both can function as verbs meaning "to process numbers or data intensively."
   - **SUE and SUE**: Both can function as verbs meaning "to initiate legal proceedings against someone."
   - **WIRELESS and WIRELESS**: Both can function as adjectives meaning "without wires or cables."

2. **Expand to groups of four:**
   - Let's see if we can find more words that fit with any of these initial pairs.

3. **Exploring further:**
   - **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SUE, DOVE**: This doesn't quite work as DOVE is more of a noun or past tense of "dive."
   - **CRUNCH, CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT**: These could all relate to the idea of the essential part or main component of something, but they don't all function as the same part of speech.
   - **WIRELESS, EARLY, BIG, DEMI**: These are all adjectives, but they don't share a specific meaning.

4. **Re-evaluate and try another angle:**
   - **THRUST, PUSH-UP, PAYDAY, SUE**: These don't align well in terms of meaning or part of speech.
   - **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, ESSENCE**: If we consider "CORE" and "SUBSTANCE" as nouns meaning the essential part, "MEAT" can also fit in this context, but we need a fourth word.

5. **Final attempt:**
   - **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, ESSENCE**: If we assume "ESSENCE" is a missing word that fits, this could be a group of nouns meaning the essential part of something.

If none of these combinations work, we might need to consider a different pattern or re-evaluate the meanings and parts of speech of the words. Let me know if you want to explore another angle or if there's a specific direction you'd like to take!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CORE PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE SUE WIRELESS THRUST DEMI MARS LADY BIG CRUNCH MEAT EARLY SPORTS PAYDAY DOVE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, following the pattern of finding words that connect to different meanings of the same word or letter.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **CORE**: 
   - Meaning 1: The central part of something (e.g., the core of an apple).
   - Meaning 2: A central or foundational part of a concept or system (e.g., core values).

2. **THRUST**:
   - Meaning 1: A forceful push or shove.
   - Meaning 2: The main point or essence of an argument or discussion.

Both "CORE" and "THRUST" can relate to the central or main part of something, but they are not directly connected to the same word or letter.

### Step 2: Explore Other Words

Let's try to find a word that connects to different meanings of the same word or letter:

1. **WIRELESS**:
   - Meaning 1: Technology that operates without physical wires (e.g., wireless internet).
   - Meaning 2: A radio or communication device that doesn't use wires.

2. **DOVE**:
   - Meaning 1: A type of bird.
   - Meaning 2: Past tense of "dive."

3. **BIG**:
   - Meaning 1: Large in size.
   - Meaning 2: Important or significant (e.g., a big decision).

4. **CRUNCH**:
   - Meaning 1: A loud, grinding sound.
   - Meaning 2: A critical situation or shortage (e.g., a budget crunch).

### Step 3: Form a Group of Four Words

Let's see if we can form a group of four words that connect to different meanings of the same word:

- **CORE**: Central part.
- **THRUST**: Main point or essence.
- **CRUNCH**: Critical situation.
- **BIG**: Important or significant.

These words can all relate to the concept of importance or centrality in different contexts, but they don't directly connect to the same word or letter.

### Conclusion

I couldn't find a group of four words that each connect to different meanings of the same word or letter. Let's try another pattern or set of words. If you have any other ideas or words to explore, let me know!

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can follow each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words and phrases rather than generic and ubiquitous words and phrases.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “George”: BOY BY CURIOUS SAINT
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Valley”: DEATH HIDDEN SILICON UNCANNY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Crane”: CONSTRUCTION FRASIER PAPER WHOOPING
Puzzle words that are each followed by “up”: AMP FIRE HYPE PUMP
Puzzle words that are each followed by “jam”: NBA PAPER PEARL TRAFFIC
Puzzle words that are each followed by “bear”: BOO-BOO BROWN HONEY TEDDY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “chip”: BLUE COMPUTER POKER POTATO
Puzzle words that are each followed by “wheel”: CHEESE COLOR HAMSTER PRAYER

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same word or phrase that follows them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words and phrases are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same word or phrase. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CROP CURIOUS BAD TANK GEE FLY BEE FRESH TEE RAD EX JAY BOY POLO BY SAINT

Output:

To tackle this puzzle effectively, let's begin by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **CROP** - dust, circles, top, rotation
- **CURIOUS** - George, case, about, nature
- **BAD** - news, influence, boy, habit
- **TANK** - top, engine, battle, fish
- **GEE** - whiz, thanks, golly, willikers
- **FLY** - swatter, fishing, high, away
- **BEE** - hive, line, pollen, movie
- **FRESH** - air, produce, start, prince
- **TEE** - shirt, time, off, ball
- **RAD** - tech, radiation, cool, level
- **EX** - wife, husband, file, change
- **JAY** - bird, walk, Z, blue
- **BOY** - scout, friend, George, band
- **POLO** - shirt, match, water, club
- **BY** - pass, law, product, George
- **SAINT** - Bernard, Mary, George, Nicholas

### Observations:

Observing a connection here with the word "George", as it follows CURIOUS (from the character Curious George), BOY (from the character Boy George), SAINT (Saint George), and BY (like in a phrase, although a bit of a stretch). Here's a pattern match:

**Pattern:** Words that are each followed by “George”

- CURIOUS
- BOY
- SAINT
- BY

Now, let's test another set of puzzle words:

1. **BAD** - followed by "guy", "habit", "blood", etc.
2. **FRESH** - followed by "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
3. **TANK** - followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
4. **TEE** - followed by "shirt", "time", "off", etc.

No obvious connection stands out here as strongly as the previous one.

Let's try one more grouping:

1. **CROP** - followed by "top", "circle", "dusting", etc.
2. **TANK** - again, followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
3. **FRESH** - mentioned earlier, "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
4. **EX** - followed by "girlfriend", "president", "employee", etc.

Here, the words "CROP" and "TANK" both could follow with "top" (crop top, tank top). However, extending this to four words with the same following phrase doesn't work in this selection.

In conclusion, for this set, the strongest pattern match I found involves:

- **CURIOUS**
- **BOY**
- **SAINT**
- **BY**

All of these can logically be followed by the word "George".

1. **EARLY** - bird, riser, adopter, morning
2. **LADY** - bug, bird, luck, gaga
3. **SPORTS** - car, center, bar, team
4. **DEMI** - Moore, god, tasse, lovato
5. **MARS** - bar, rover, attacks, planet
6. **MEAT** - loaf, ball, market, pie
7. **SUE** - storm, grafton, sylvester, ellen

9. **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, matter, control
10. **PAYDAY** - loan, bar, advance, schedule
11. **CORE** - strength, value, temperature, group
12. **DOVE** - bar, soap, chocolate, peace
13. **PUSH-UP** - bra, exercise, challenge, bar
14. **WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, router
15. **BIG** - bang, deal, apple, brother
16. **CRUNCH** - time, bar, numbers, abs

### Potential Matches:

- **BAR**: This word can follow several puzzle words:
  - **MARS** - Mars bar
  - **PAYDAY** - Payday bar
  - **DOVE** - Dove bar
  - **CRUNCH** - Crunch bar

This gives us a potential pattern match:

**Pattern:** Words that are each followed by “bar”

- **MARS**
- **PAYDAY**
- **DOVE**
- **CRUNCH**

This set of words can all logically be followed by "bar", which is a common term for types of candy bars.

If this pattern doesn't work, let me know, and we can try another approach.
