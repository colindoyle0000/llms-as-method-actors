Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can substitute for each other. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can substitute for each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can substitute for each other.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to eat voraciously”: DOWN INHALE SCARF WOLF
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “universal”: BLANKET BROAD GENERAL SWEEPING
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “shared”: COLLECTIVE COMMON JOINT MUTUAL
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to rid of contents”: CLEAR DRAIN EMPTY FLUSH
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “method”: CHANNEL MEANS MEDIUM VEHICLE
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “unlikely (as a chance)”: OUTSIDE REMOTE SLIM SMALL
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “a large amount”: MASS SEA SLEW TON
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to fall in under pressure”: BUCKLE CAVE COLLAPSE GIVE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to express indirectly”: COUCH IMPLY INTIMATE SUGGEST
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to wager”: BET GAMBLE RISK STAKE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also substitute for the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can substitute for each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can substitute for each other, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: EARLY SPORTS WIRELESS SUE DEMI BIG LADY PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying words that can substitute for each other based on their meanings and parts of speech.

1. **EARLY**: This is an adjective meaning "before the usual or expected time."

2. **SPORTS**: This is a noun, typically referring to physical activities or games.

3. **WIRELESS**: This can be an adjective meaning "without wires," often used to describe technology.

4. **SUE**: This is a verb meaning "to take legal action against someone."

5. **DEMI**: This is an adjective meaning "half" or "partially."

6. **BIG**: This is an adjective meaning "large in size."

7. **LADY**: This is a noun meaning "a woman."

8. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun referring to a type of exercise.

Now, let's look for potential connections:

- **EARLY** and **BIG**: Both are adjectives, but they don't share a similar meaning.
- **WIRELESS** and **DEMI**: Both are adjectives, but they don't share a similar meaning.
- **SUE**: This is a verb, so it doesn't match with any of the adjectives or nouns.
- **SPORTS** and **PUSH-UP**: Both are nouns related to physical activity, but they don't substitute for each other directly.
- **LADY**: This is a noun, but it doesn't have a direct substitute among the other words.

Let's try to find a group of four words that can substitute for each other:

- **EARLY**, **WIRELESS**, **DEMI**, **BIG**: All are adjectives, but they don't share a common meaning.
- **SPORTS**, **PUSH-UP**: Both are related to physical activity, but we need two more words to form a group of four.

It seems like these words don't form a clear group of four that can substitute for each other based on the given pattern. Let's try another approach or pattern if needed. If you have any other ideas or words to consider, let me know!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: LADY DEMI EARLY PUSH-UP SPORTS SUE WIRELESS BIG

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding connections between the puzzle words and different meanings of the same word or letter.

1. **LADY**: 
   - Could refer to a woman or a title (e.g., "Lady" as in nobility).

2. **DEMI**:
   - Could refer to "demi" as in half (e.g., demi-glace) or a name (e.g., Demi Moore).

3. **EARLY**:
   - Could refer to time (e.g., early morning) or a name (e.g., Early as a surname).

4. **PUSH-UP**:
   - Could refer to an exercise or a type of bra.

5. **SPORTS**:
   - Could refer to physical activities or a type of car (e.g., sports car).

6. **SUE**:
   - Could refer to a legal action (e.g., to sue someone) or a name (e.g., Sue as a first name).

7. **WIRELESS**:
   - Could refer to technology (e.g., wireless internet) or a type of radio.

8. **BIG**:
   - Could refer to size or a name (e.g., Big as in Big Ben).

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **LADY** and **SUE**: Both can be names or titles. "Lady" as a title and "Sue" as a name.
- **DEMI** and **PUSH-UP**: "Demi" can refer to half, and "Push-up" can refer to a type of bra, which often has a "demi" style.
- **EARLY** and **WIRELESS**: "Early" can refer to time, and "Wireless" can refer to early technology (e.g., early wireless radios).
- **SPORTS** and **BIG**: "Sports" can refer to a type of car, and "Big" can refer to size, as in a "big sports event."

Let's see if we can find a common word or letter that connects these:

- **LADY** and **SUE**: Both can be connected to the word "name."
- **DEMI** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can be connected to the word "half" (demi meaning half, and push-up bras often have a demi style).
- **EARLY** and **WIRELESS**: Both can be connected to the word "technology" (early technology, wireless technology).
- **SPORTS** and **BIG**: Both can be connected to the word "event" (big sports event).

It seems like we have a potential pattern here, but we need to ensure that each word connects to a different meaning of the same word or letter. Let's refine this:

- **LADY** (title) and **SUE** (name): Connect to "name."
- **DEMI** (half) and **PUSH-UP** (bra style): Connect to "half."
- **EARLY** (time) and **WIRELESS** (technology): Connect to "early."
- **SPORTS** (activity) and **BIG** (size): Connect to "event."

This is a challenging puzzle, and while we have some potential connections, we may need to explore further or consider other patterns if this doesn't fully align with the intended solution. Let me know if you want to explore other possibilities or if there's another pattern to consider.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can follow each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words and phrases rather than generic and ubiquitous words and phrases.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “George”: BOY BY CURIOUS SAINT
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Valley”: DEATH HIDDEN SILICON UNCANNY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Crane”: CONSTRUCTION FRASIER PAPER WHOOPING
Puzzle words that are each followed by “up”: AMP FIRE HYPE PUMP
Puzzle words that are each followed by “jam”: NBA PAPER PEARL TRAFFIC
Puzzle words that are each followed by “bear”: BOO-BOO BROWN HONEY TEDDY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “chip”: BLUE COMPUTER POKER POTATO
Puzzle words that are each followed by “wheel”: CHEESE COLOR HAMSTER PRAYER

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same word or phrase that follows them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words and phrases are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same word or phrase. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CROP CURIOUS BAD TANK GEE FLY BEE FRESH TEE RAD EX JAY BOY POLO BY SAINT

Output:

To tackle this puzzle effectively, let's begin by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **CROP** - dust, circles, top, rotation
- **CURIOUS** - George, case, about, nature
- **BAD** - news, influence, boy, habit
- **TANK** - top, engine, battle, fish
- **GEE** - whiz, thanks, golly, willikers
- **FLY** - swatter, fishing, high, away
- **BEE** - hive, line, pollen, movie
- **FRESH** - air, produce, start, prince
- **TEE** - shirt, time, off, ball
- **RAD** - tech, radiation, cool, level
- **EX** - wife, husband, file, change
- **JAY** - bird, walk, Z, blue
- **BOY** - scout, friend, George, band
- **POLO** - shirt, match, water, club
- **BY** - pass, law, product, George
- **SAINT** - Bernard, Mary, George, Nicholas

### Observations:

Observing a connection here with the word "George", as it follows CURIOUS (from the character Curious George), BOY (from the character Boy George), SAINT (Saint George), and BY (like in a phrase, although a bit of a stretch). Here's a pattern match:

**Pattern:** Words that are each followed by “George”

- CURIOUS
- BOY
- SAINT
- BY

Now, let's test another set of puzzle words:

1. **BAD** - followed by "guy", "habit", "blood", etc.
2. **FRESH** - followed by "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
3. **TANK** - followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
4. **TEE** - followed by "shirt", "time", "off", etc.

No obvious connection stands out here as strongly as the previous one.

Let's try one more grouping:

1. **CROP** - followed by "top", "circle", "dusting", etc.
2. **TANK** - again, followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
3. **FRESH** - mentioned earlier, "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
4. **EX** - followed by "girlfriend", "president", "employee", etc.

Here, the words "CROP" and "TANK" both could follow with "top" (crop top, tank top). However, extending this to four words with the same following phrase doesn't work in this selection.

In conclusion, for this set, the strongest pattern match I found involves:

- **CURIOUS**
- **BOY**
- **SAINT**
- **BY**

All of these can logically be followed by the word "George".

— end of example input and output —


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS SUE SPORTS EARLY DEMI LADY PUSH-UP BIG

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle by brainstorming potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. Our goal is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, router
- **SUE** - storm, bird, Grafton, Sylvester
- **SPORTS** - car, team, center, bar
- **EARLY** - bird, riser, adopter, morning
- **DEMI** - Moore, god, Lovato, tasse
- **LADY** - bird, Gaga, luck, killer
- **PUSH-UP** - bra, exercise, challenge, bar
- **BIG** - deal, bang, apple, time

### Observations:

Let's look for a common word or phrase that can follow four of these puzzle words.

1. **WIRELESS** - "network" or "connection" are common, but don't seem to fit with others.
2. **SUE** - "storm" could work with "EARLY" (early storm), but not with others.
3. **SPORTS** - "car" is a possibility, but doesn't fit with others.
4. **EARLY** - "bird" is a strong candidate, as it can also follow "LADY" (ladybird).
5. **DEMI** - "Moore" is specific, but doesn't fit with others.
6. **LADY** - "bird" works here, as mentioned.
7. **PUSH-UP** - "bra" or "challenge" are specific, but don't fit with others.
8. **BIG** - "deal" or "bang" are common, but don't fit with others.

### Potential Pattern:

The word "bird" seems to be a potential candidate that can follow multiple words:

- **EARLY** - bird
- **LADY** - bird
- **SUE** - bird (as in the character Sue Bird, a famous basketball player)
- **SPORTS** - bird (as in sports bird, though a bit of a stretch)

This is a bit of a stretch, but it's the closest pattern I can identify with the given words. If this doesn't work, we might need to consider other potential patterns or words that could follow these puzzle words. Let me know if you want to explore another set of words or patterns.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are parts of the same thing or process

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the puzzle words are parts of the same thing or process.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each parts of a car: BUMPER HOOD TIRE TRUNK
Puzzle words that are each cuts of pork: BELLY CHOP HOCK SHOULDER
Puzzle words that are each seen in a laundry room: DRYER HAMPER IRON WASHER
Puzzle words that are each sections of a book: APPENDIX CHAPTER INDEX PREFACE
Puzzle words that are each things used to build a snowman: CARROT COAL SNOW STICKS
Puzzle words that are each parts of a golf course: BUNKER FAIRWAY GREEN ROUGH
Puzzle words that are each pinball machine components: BALL BUMPER FLIPPER PLUNGER
Puzzle words that are each parts of a shoe: EYELET LACE SOLE TONGUE
Puzzle words that are each parts of a river: BANK BED DELTA MOUTH
Puzzle words that are each in the nato alphabet: ALFA BRAVO ROMEO TANGO

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by being part of the same thing or process. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SPORTS SUE WIRELESS PUSH-UP LADY BIG EARLY DEMI

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step and see if we can find a connection between these words that fits the pattern of being parts of the same thing or process.

1. **SPORTS**: This could refer to various types of physical activities or games. It might also relate to equipment or attire associated with sports.

2. **SUE**: This is a bit tricky. It could refer to a legal action or perhaps a name. In a different context, it might be part of a phrase or idiom.

3. **WIRELESS**: This typically refers to technology that operates without physical connections, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

4. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise, specifically a bodyweight exercise targeting the upper body.

5. **LADY**: This could refer to a woman or be part of a title or phrase.

6. **BIG**: This is an adjective that describes size. It could be part of a phrase or idiom.

7. **EARLY**: This refers to time, indicating something happening before the usual or expected time.

8. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half or partial. It could also refer to a name or be part of a phrase.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **SPORTS** and **PUSH-UP**: Both relate to physical activity or exercise. They could be part of a fitness routine or regimen.

- **WIRELESS**: This could be part of a modern fitness routine, as many fitness devices and headphones are wireless.

- **EARLY**: This could relate to the time of day when people often exercise, such as early morning workouts.

Based on these connections, we could propose that the words **SPORTS**, **PUSH-UP**, **WIRELESS**, and **EARLY** are parts of a modern fitness routine or lifestyle. 

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can explore other connections or patterns. Let me know if you think of any other angles or if we should try a different approach!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous verbs.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to shepherd”: DIRECT GUIDE LEAD STEER
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to contact via phone”: BUZZ CALL DIAL RING
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to separate”: DIVIDE FORK PART SPLIT

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to update for accuracy”: AMEND CORRECT FIX REVISE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to breathe heavily”: GASPS HUFFS PANTS PUFFS

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: LADY PUSH-UP EARLY DEMI WIRELESS BIG SPORTS SUE

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding synonymous verbs.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs.**

1. **PUSH-UP**: As a verb, "push-up" doesn't quite fit, but "push" can mean to "press" or "shove."
2. **SUE**: As a verb, "sue" means to "take legal action" or "litigate."

These two don't seem to be synonymous, so let's try other words.

3. **WIRELESS**: As a verb, "wireless" doesn't work, but "wire" can mean to "connect" or "transmit."
4. **SPORTS**: As a verb, "sport" can mean to "display" or "show off."

Again, these don't match. Let's try more combinations.

5. **LADY**: As a verb, "lady" doesn't work.
6. **EARLY**: As a verb, "early" doesn't work.
7. **DEMI**: As a verb, "demi" doesn't work.
8. **BIG**: As a verb, "big" doesn't work.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.**

Let's try to find a new pair:

- **PUSH-UP**: "Push" can mean to "press" or "shove."
- **WIRELESS**: "Wire" can mean to "connect" or "transmit."

These don't match, so let's try another approach.

- **SUE**: "Sue" means to "litigate."
- **SPORTS**: "Sport" can mean to "display" or "show off."

These don't match either.

**Conclusion:**

It seems that none of the words provided can form a group of four synonymous verbs. We might need to consider a different pattern or set of words. If you have another set of words or a different pattern to try, let me know!
