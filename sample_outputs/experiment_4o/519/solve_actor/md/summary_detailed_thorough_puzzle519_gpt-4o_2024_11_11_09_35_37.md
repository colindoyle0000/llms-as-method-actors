## Evaluations

### Evaluation 1

Let's analyze the notes and the list of words to determine the best guesses for the puzzle.

### Step One: Evaluate Each Guess

1. **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**
   - **Connection**: Names of candy bars.
   - **Strength**: Strong. Each word is a well-known candy bar, and the connection is specific and unique.

2. **PAYDAY PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**
   - **Connection**: Can be preceded by "BIG."
   - **Strength**: Moderate. While "BIG" can precede each word, the connection is less unique and more generic.

3. **CRUNCH MARS PAYDAY SPORTS**
   - **Connection**: Can be followed by "bar."
   - **Strength**: Moderate. While CRUNCH, MARS, and PAYDAY are candy bars, SPORTS is more commonly associated with "sports bar," which is a different context.

4. **DOVE MARS PAYDAY SPORTS**
   - **Connection**: Can modify "BAR."
   - **Strength**: Moderate. Similar to the previous guess, but DOVE is a candy bar, and SPORTS is more of a venue type.

### Step Two: Select Two Top Choices

Based on the analysis, the two strongest guesses are:

- **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: Strong connection as candy bars.
- **PAYDAY PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**: Moderate connection with "BIG."

These two guesses do not overlap in terms of words, which is a good sign.

### Step Three: Determine the Strongest Choice

The strongest choice is **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY** because the connection is specific, unique, and applies equally to all four words as candy bars. The connection is more subtle and unique compared to the more generic "BIG" prefix.

### Final Decision

Submit **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY** as the top choice for the puzzle. This guess has the strongest and most specific connection among the options provided.

### Evaluation 2

Let's analyze each of the guesses provided in the notes and evaluate their strengths based on the criteria given:

1. **BIG CORE THRUST WIRELESS**
   - Connection: Technology and innovation.
   - Evaluation: The connection is somewhat broad and not equally specific for each word. "Wireless" fits well, but "Big" and "Thrust" are more loosely connected to technology. This guess seems weak because the connection isn't equally strong for all words.

2. **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**
   - Connection: Essential part or essence.
   - Evaluation: This connection is strong because each word can indeed represent the core or fundamental aspect of something. The connection is equally specific for each word, making this a strong guess.

3. **CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**
   - Connection: Exercise and physical activity.
   - Evaluation: "Core," "Push-up," and "Thrust" fit well with exercise, but "Sports" is a broader category. The connection is not equally specific for all words, making this a weaker guess.

4. **BIG DEMI LADY MEAT**
   - Connection: Forming compound words or phrases.
   - Evaluation: Each word can indeed form a common compound word or phrase, and the connection is equally specific for each word. This is a strong guess.

Now, let's select the two top choices that do not overlap:

- **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**: Strong connection with no overlap with the other strong guess.
- **BIG DEMI LADY MEAT**: Strong connection with no overlap with the other strong guess.

Finally, determine which of these two is the strongest:

- **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**: This guess has a very clear and specific connection that applies equally to all words, making it the strongest choice.

Therefore, my top choice for a guess to submit is **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**.

### Evaluation 3

Let's evaluate each of the guesses based on the criteria provided:

1. **DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS WIRELESS**: 
   - **Connection**: Types of bras.
   - **Strength**: This connection is quite specific and unique. Each word clearly represents a different style or feature of a bra. The connection fits each word equally well and with the same level of specificity. All words have the same relationship to the connection as they are all types of bras.

2. **DEMI EARLY LADY SUE**:
   - **Connection**: Names or titles.
   - **Strength**: This connection is weaker because "Early" as a surname is less common and not as specific as the other words. The connection is not equally strong for each word, and the level of specificity varies. "Lady" is a title, while "Sue" and "Demi" are more commonly first names, making the relationship to the connection inconsistent.

3. **BIG DEMI LADY SUE**:
   - **Connection**: Pop culture references.
   - **Strength**: This connection is somewhat subjective and relies on specific knowledge of pop culture. While each word can be associated with a figure or title, the connection is not as direct or specific as the first guess. The relationship to the connection varies, as "Big" refers to a movie, while the others refer to people.

Based on the analysis, the strongest guess is **DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS WIRELESS**. This guess has a clear, specific, and unique connection that applies equally and consistently to all four words. Therefore, I would submit this guess.
