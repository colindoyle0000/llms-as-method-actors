Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Based on the analysis provided, the strongest potential connection identified is between the words **WIRELESS, BIG, THRUST, CORE**. These words seem to have a cohesive connection related to technology and innovation, which aligns with the patterns typically found in New York Times connections puzzles.

However, before submitting this guess, let's quickly reassess:

1. **WIRELESS, BIG, THRUST, CORE**: 
   - "Wireless" could relate to wireless technology.
   - "Big" could relate to "big data" or "big tech."
   - "Thrust" could relate to technological advancements or engineering.
   - "Core" could relate to core technology or core components in tech.

This connection seems plausible, as it fits the pattern of words relating to technology and innovation. 

Given the options and the analysis, it seems reasonable to submit **WIRELESS, BIG, THRUST, CORE** as a guess. It is the most cohesive and specific connection identified from the notes provided.

Therefore, I recommend submitting this guess. If it turns out to be incorrect, we can then go back to brainstorming other possible connections.

"""

user: Yes = submit a guess. No = go back to brainstorming.
