## Prompts

system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Based on the analysis of the potential guesses provided in the notes, the strongest candidate for submission is the group **DEMI, BIG, MEAT, LADY**. This group forms a clear and precise connection where each word can be followed by another word to form a common compound word or phrase: "demi-god," "big-shot," "meat-ball," and "lady-bug." This connection fits the pattern of words being followed by the same word or phrase, which is a typical pattern in New York Times connections puzzles.

The other potential guesses, such as **THRUST, PUSH-UP, BIG, CORE** and **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, WIRELESS**, do not have as strong or precise a connection and do not fit the typical patterns as well.

Therefore, you should submit the guess **DEMI, BIG, MEAT, LADY** as an answer for this puzzle.
