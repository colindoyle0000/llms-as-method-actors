Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words are each a way to do the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each a way to remove hair: SHAVE THREAD TWEEZE WAX
Puzzle words that are each a way to preserve food: CAN CURE DRY FREEZE
Puzzle words that are each a way to get attention: SHOUT SNAP WAVE WHISTLE
Puzzle words that are each a way to say “I give!”: ENOUGH MERCY STOP UNCLE
Puzzle words that are each a way to say “Step on it!": FASTER GO HURRY MOVE
Puzzle words that are each a way to preserve a meat: CANS CURES SALTS SMOKES
Puzzle words that are each a way to say “My mistake!”: APOLOGIES OOPS PARDON SORRY
Puzzle words that are each a way to say a win is assured: CLINCH GUARANTEE LOCK SECURE
Puzzle words that are each a way to take a tumble: FALL SLIP SPILL TRIP
Puzzle words that are each a slang way to say “head” using food words: BEAN MELON NOODLE NUT

Step 2: See if other puzzle words are also a way to do that same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE THRUST DEMI SPORTS LADY EARLY CORE BIG PUSH-UP MEAT SUE WIRELESS

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential patterns among the puzzle words. We'll start by looking for two words that could be a way to do the same thing, then see if we can expand that to four words.

1. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to a material or essence.
2. **THRUST**: This could mean to push or drive with force.
3. **DEMI**: This could mean half or partial.
4. **SPORTS**: This could refer to physical activities or games.
5. **LADY**: This could refer to a woman.
6. **EARLY**: This could mean before the usual time.
7. **CORE**: This could mean the central or most important part.
8. **BIG**: This could mean large in size or importance.
9. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.
10. **MEAT**: This could refer to animal flesh used as food.
11. **SUE**: This could mean to take legal action against someone.
12. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to technology that operates without wires.

Let's try to identify a pattern:

- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both involve a pushing action.
- **SUE**: This is a legal action, not directly related to the others.
- **WIRELESS**: This is related to technology, not directly related to the others.

Let's focus on the pushing action:

- **THRUST**: To push or drive with force.
- **PUSH-UP**: An exercise involving pushing the body up.
- **BIG**: Could be related if we consider "big push" as a phrase meaning a significant effort.
- **CORE**: In fitness, core exercises often involve pushing or stabilizing actions.

This gives us a potential group related to physical exertion or effort:

- **THRUST**
- **PUSH-UP**
- **BIG** (as in "big push")
- **CORE** (as in core exercises)

This group could be interpreted as ways to exert physical effort or perform exercises. Let's see if this fits the pattern of "ways to do the same thing" in terms of physical exertion or exercise.

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can explore other combinations or patterns. Let me know if you want to try a different approach or if you have any other ideas!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI SUE BIG CORE MEAT SPORTS PUSH-UP THRUST WIRELESS SUBSTANCE EARLY LADY

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on finding synonymous adjectives among the given words.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives.

1. **BIG**: This can be an adjective meaning large or significant.
2. **CORE**: While "core" is often a noun, it can also be used as an adjective meaning central or essential.

These two words can be synonymous in the sense of being central or significant.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words identified.

3. **SUBSTANCE**: As an adjective, "substantial" (derived from substance) can mean significant or important, aligning with "big" and "core."
4. **LADY**: This is typically a noun, but if we consider "ladylike" as an adjective, it doesn't fit the pattern. Let's try another word.

Let's try another approach:

1. **EARLY**: This can be an adjective meaning happening or done before the usual or expected time.
2. **DEMI**: As an adjective, "demi" can mean partial or half, but it doesn't fit with "early."

Let's try another pair:

1. **WIRELESS**: This can be an adjective meaning without wires, often used to describe technology.
2. **SPORTS**: As an adjective, it can describe something related to sports, but it doesn't fit with "wireless."

Let's try another pair:

1. **PUSH-UP**: This is typically a noun, but as an adjective, it can describe a type of bra or exercise.
2. **THRUST**: As an adjective, "thrust" doesn't fit well.

Let's try another pair:

1. **SUE**: This is typically a verb or a name, not an adjective.
2. **MEAT**: As an adjective, "meaty" can mean substantial or significant, but it doesn't fit with "sue."

Let's try another pair:

1. **DEMI**: As an adjective, "demi" can mean partial or half.
2. **EARLY**: As an adjective, it means happening or done before the usual or expected time.

These two don't fit together well.

It seems challenging to find four words that fit the pattern of synonymous adjectives from this list. Let's try another pattern or set of words. If you have any other ideas or patterns, please let me know!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI WIRELESS SPORTS THRUST SUE SUBSTANCE PUSH-UP CORE LADY BIG EARLY MEAT

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, following the pattern of finding synonyms that function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms.

1. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can function as verbs meaning "to push forcefully." However, "push-up" is more commonly known as a noun referring to an exercise, so this might not be the best pair.

2. **BIG** and **LADY**: These don't seem to have a direct synonym relationship.

3. **WIRELESS** and **CORE**: These don't seem to have a direct synonym relationship.

4. **SUE** and **DEMI**: These don't seem to have a direct synonym relationship.

5. **SUBSTANCE** and **MEAT**: Both can function as nouns meaning "the essential part or essence of something." This seems like a promising pair.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.

- **SUBSTANCE** and **MEAT**: As mentioned, both can mean the essential part or essence.
- **CORE**: This can also mean the central or most important part, aligning with "substance" and "meat."
- **ESSENCE**: If it were in the list, it would fit, but let's see if any other words can fit this meaning.

Unfortunately, none of the other words seem to fit this specific synonym group. Let's try another approach.

Step 1: Identify another pair of synonyms.

1. **EARLY** and **BIG**: These don't seem to have a direct synonym relationship.

2. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Re-evaluating, "thrust" and "push" can be synonyms as verbs meaning "to push forcefully."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.

- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: As verbs, "thrust" and "push" align.
- **SUE**: This doesn't fit with the meaning of "push forcefully."
- **WIRELESS**: This doesn't fit with the meaning of "push forcefully."
- **SPORTS**: This doesn't fit with the meaning of "push forcefully."
- **CORE**: This doesn't fit with the meaning of "push forcefully."
- **LADY**: This doesn't fit with the meaning of "push forcefully."
- **BIG**: This doesn't fit with the meaning of "push forcefully."
- **EARLY**: This doesn't fit with the meaning of "push forcefully."
- **MEAT**: This doesn't fit with the meaning of "push forcefully."
- **DEMI**: This doesn't fit with the meaning of "push forcefully."

It seems we're struggling to find a group of four words that fit a single synonym pattern. Let's try another pattern or approach.

If we can't find a solution, we might need to consider a different pattern or get more context on the puzzle. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if we should try a different approach.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same set of letters

Steps to take: 

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm letters or words that can follow each word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular sets of letters or words rather than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “berry”: BLUE GOOSE RASP STRAW
Puzzle words that are each followed by “land countries”: ICE IRE FIN NETHER
Puzzle words that are each followed by “-o”: DADDY DAY JACKIE JELL

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same set of letters or words that can follow them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular sets of letters or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words. 

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have that same set of letters or word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same set of letters or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST SPORTS PUSH-UP SUE MEAT LADY SUBSTANCE CORE WIRELESS BIG DEMI EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying connections between the words that could represent different aspects of the same thing.

1. **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: Both words relate to force or movement. "Thrust" is a forceful push or drive, and "push-up" involves pushing oneself up from the ground. They could be aspects of physical exertion or force.

2. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: Both words can relate to the essence or central part of something. "Core" is the central part, and "substance" is the essential material or essence of something. They could be aspects of the fundamental nature of an object or concept.

3. **WIRELESS and EARLY**: These words don't immediately suggest a connection, but let's consider them further. "Wireless" could relate to technology or communication, while "early" could relate to time or timing. They might not fit together directly, but let's keep them in mind.

4. **SPORTS and MEAT**: These words don't seem to connect directly. "Sports" relates to physical activities or games, while "meat" is a type of food. They might not fit the pattern we're looking for.

5. **LADY and DEMI**: "Lady" refers to a woman, and "demi" is a prefix meaning half or partial. They don't seem to connect directly in terms of aspects of the same thing.

6. **BIG**: This word relates to size or magnitude. It could potentially connect with "core" or "substance" if we're considering aspects of size or importance.

Let's try to form a group of four words:

- **CORE, SUBSTANCE, BIG, DEMI**: These could relate to different aspects of size or importance. "Core" and "substance" relate to the essence or central part, "big" relates to size, and "demi" could relate to partial or smaller size.

This is a potential group, but it might not be the strongest connection. Let's consider another possibility:

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, WIRELESS**: These could relate to different aspects of physical activity or exertion. "Thrust" and "push-up" relate to force and movement, "sports" relates to physical activities, and "wireless" could relate to modern sports technology or communication.

This second group seems to have a more cohesive connection. Let's go with this as a potential solution. If it doesn't fit, we can revisit and try another combination.
