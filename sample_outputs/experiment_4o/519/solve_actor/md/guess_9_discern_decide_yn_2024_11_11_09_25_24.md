system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's analyze the potential connections for the words provided and see if any of the guesses from the notes are strong enough to submit:

1. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**:
   - The proposed connection was that these words are each one letter away from words related to physical activities or exercises. However, this connection was weak and forced, especially with the transformation of "CORE" to "CURE."

2. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT**:
   - The proposed connection was that these words all relate to the concept of "essence" or "central part." This connection is strong and coherent, as each word clearly relates to the idea of an "essence" or "central part."

Given the analysis, the second option, **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT**, is the strongest viable guess. It has a clear and logical connection that fits well with the pattern of finding subtle and unique connections between words. Therefore, I would recommend submitting this guess.

If you are confident in this connection, it would be a good idea to submit it as one of the answers to the puzzle. If not, we can continue brainstorming other possible connections. However, based on the information provided, the second option seems like a strong candidate.
