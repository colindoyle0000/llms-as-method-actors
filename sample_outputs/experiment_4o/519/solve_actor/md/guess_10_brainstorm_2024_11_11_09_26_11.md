Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words are each a type of the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each a type of name prefix: GEN MS PROF REV
Puzzle words that are each a type of road name: ALLEY DRIVE LANE STREET
Puzzle words that are each a type of interval of time: PERIOD SPELL STRETCH WHILE
Puzzle words that are each a type of farm tool: HOE PLOW RAKE SICKLE
Puzzle words that are each a type of sports venue: ARENA BOWL DOME FIELD
Puzzle words that are each a type of murky condition: CLOUD FOG HAZE MIST
Puzzle words that are each a type of luxurious fabric: CHIFFON SATIN SILK VELVET
Puzzle words that are each a type of ice cream treat: FLOAT SHAKE SPLIT SUNDAE
Puzzle words that are each a type of hardware fastener: BOLT NAIL RIVET SCREW
Puzzle words that are each a type of cooking oil: CORN OLIVE PALM PEANUT

Step 2: See if other puzzle words are also a type of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE WIRELESS SUBSTANCE MEAT DEMI THRUST PUSH-UP LADY SPORTS BIG EARLY CORE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, looking for connections between the words that might fit the pattern of being types of the same thing.

1. **SUE**: This could refer to a legal action or a name.
2. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to technology or communication.
3. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a broad term that could refer to materials or chemicals.
4. **MEAT**: This refers to food, specifically animal flesh.
5. **DEMI**: This could refer to a prefix meaning "half" or a name.
6. **THRUST**: This could refer to a force or movement.
7. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.
8. **LADY**: This could refer to a woman or a title.
9. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games.
10. **BIG**: This is an adjective describing size.
11. **EARLY**: This is an adjective describing time.
12. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something or a type of exercise.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP** are both related to physical movement or exercise.
- **CORE** is also related to exercise, specifically core exercises.
- **SPORTS** is related to physical activity, which can include exercises.

We have a potential group here: **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**. These are all related to physical activity or exercise.

Let's see if this fits the pattern: Puzzle words that are each a type of the same thing. In this case, they are all types of physical activity or exercise-related terms.

This seems like a plausible solution. If this doesn't fit the intended pattern, we can try another approach. Let me know if you want to explore other possibilities!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each come after the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can come before each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each come after “SECRET”: AGENT CODE SANTA SAUCE
Puzzle words that each come after “FUNNY”: BONE BUSINESS GIRL PAGES
Puzzle words that each come after “SILVER”: FOX LINING SCREEN SPOON
Puzzle words that each come after “STICKY”: FINGERS NOTE RICE WICKET
Puzzle words that each come after “SECOND”: FIDDLE GUESS NATURE WIND
Puzzle words that each come after “PLAY”: DATE DEAD DIRTY DOH
Puzzle words that each come after “CAT’S” : CRADLE EYE MEOW PAJAMAS
Puzzle words that each come after “SPACE”: BAR CADET HEATER STATION
Puzzle words that each come after “LIVING”: LARGE LEGEND PROOF ROOM
Puzzle words that each come after “HEAD OF”: HAIR LETTUCE STATE STEAM

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can have the same word come before them.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same word come before them, trying to arrive at a group of four words that can each have the same word come before them. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BABY SEGMENT DEAR SANTA LINE FIRE POINT BOO RAY JUICE ENERGY AGENT ZIP LOVE CODE SAUCE

Output:

Let’s examine the list of puzzle words provided to see what words come before these words, then identify puzzle words from the list that have the same words that commonly come before them, then identify what other puzzle words could form this connection, then arrive at a conclusion.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**BABY** - newborn, my, little, sweet

**SEGMENT** - market, audience

**DEAR** - my, oh

**SANTA** - dear, secret

**LINE** - front, base, guide, head, through

**FIRE** - forest, camp, house, bon

**POINT** - focal, starting, main, critical

**BOO** - peek-a-, boo-

**RAY** - x-, sun, gamma, manta

**JUICE** - orange, apple, fruit, grape

**ENERGY** - renewable, solar, kinetic, nuclear

**AGENT** - special, real estate, secret, travel

**ZIP** - 

**LOVE** - true, self, romantic, unconditional

**CODE** - zip, area, bar, dress

**SAUCE** - hot, tomato, soy, barbecue

**Step 2: Puzzle words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Secret - SANTA, AGENT

**Step 3: What other puzzle word could have secret come before them?**

Secret BABY? No

Secret SEGMENT? No

Secret DEAR? No

Secret LINE? No

Secret FIRE? No

Secret POINT? No

Secret BOO? Unlikely

Secret RAY? No

Secret JUICE? No

Secret ENERGY? Unlikely

Secret ZIP? No

Secret LOVE? Maybe

Secret CODE? Yes

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST CORE BIG SUE WIRELESS SPORTS DEMI PUSH-UP MEAT EARLY SUBSTANCE LADY

## Output

Let's work through this step by step to find a possible solution to the puzzle.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

1. **THRUST** - rocket, power, engine, main
2. **CORE** - apple, nuclear, earth, hard
3. **BIG** - bang, apple, deal, time
4. **SUE** - law, legal, dear
5. **WIRELESS** - network, internet, connection, technology
6. **SPORTS** - car, news, center, team
7. **DEMI** - god, Moore, tasse
8. **PUSH-UP** - bra, exercise, challenge
9. **MEAT** - red, ground, white, market
10. **EARLY** - bird, morning, riser, adopter
11. **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, chemical, control, matter
12. **LADY** - first, young, leading, iron

**Step 2: Puzzle words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Let's identify any common words that can precede multiple puzzle words:

- **BIG**: apple, deal, time
- **WIRELESS**: network, internet, connection
- **SPORTS**: car, news, center
- **EARLY**: bird, morning, riser, adopter

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same word come before them**

Let's try to find a common word that can precede four of these puzzle words:

- **BIG**: apple, deal, time
- **WIRELESS**: network, internet, connection
- **SPORTS**: car, news, center
- **EARLY**: bird, morning, riser, adopter

**Step 4: Conclusion**

After examining the list, it seems challenging to find a single word that can precede four of these puzzle words. However, let's consider a possible pattern:

- **BIG**: apple, deal, time
- **WIRELESS**: network, internet, connection
- **SPORTS**: car, news, center
- **EARLY**: bird, morning, riser, adopter

One possible connection could be "BIG" as it can precede "apple" and "deal," and "EARLY" can precede "bird" and "adopter." However, this doesn't form a complete set of four words with a single preceding word.

If we can't find a group of four words that fit the pattern, we may need to try another approach or pattern. Let me know if you'd like to explore another pattern or if there's anything else I can assist with.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each share the same unique characteristic. For this pattern, the connection is with how the puzzle words are structured or how the words sound, not with what the words mean.

Steps to take:

Step 1: Say different puzzle words aloud and try to identify two puzzle words that share a unique characteristic related to how the word is structured or sounds. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular characteristics are more likely to be the correct connection than generic and ubiquitous characteristics. Think outside the box.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each heteronyms: BASS DOVE DESERT WIND
Puzzle words that are each letter spellings: BEE EX GEE JAY
Puzzle words that are each two letters + number: CANINE FREIGHT OFTEN STONE
Puzzle words that are each examples of onomatopoeia: BANG PLOP SPLASH THUD
Puzzle words that are each ”-ough” words that don’t rhyme: BOUGH COUGH DOUGH TOUGH
Puzzle words that are each words you say twice in a row: BOO POM TOM YO
Puzzle words that are each palindromes: BIB EYE GAG POP

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can have that same characteristic. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Try saying each puzzle word aloud to hear if the linguistic characteristic is present. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four words, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST PUSH-UP MEAT EARLY SPORTS WIRELESS BIG SUE SUBSTANCE LADY CORE DEMI

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying a unique characteristic related to how the words are structured or sound. We'll go through the list and see if we can find a pattern.

1. **THRUST**
2. **PUSH-UP**
3. **MEAT**
4. **EARLY**
5. **SPORTS**
6. **WIRELESS**
7. **BIG**
8. **SUE**
9. **SUBSTANCE**
10. **LADY**
11. **CORE**
12. **DEMI**

Let's start by saying these words aloud and considering their structure and sound:

- **THRUST**: Ends with "-st"
- **PUSH-UP**: Compound word
- **MEAT**: Simple, one-syllable
- **EARLY**: Ends with "-ly"
- **SPORTS**: Ends with "-ts"
- **WIRELESS**: Ends with "-less"
- **BIG**: Simple, one-syllable
- **SUE**: Simple, one-syllable
- **SUBSTANCE**: Ends with "-ance"
- **LADY**: Ends with "-y"
- **CORE**: Simple, one-syllable
- **DEMI**: Prefix meaning "half"

Now, let's look for a pattern:

1. **Compound Words**: PUSH-UP, WIRELESS
2. **Words Ending in "-y"**: EARLY, LADY
3. **Words Ending in "-st" or "-ts"**: THRUST, SPORTS
4. **Simple, One-Syllable Words**: MEAT, BIG, SUE, CORE

Let's explore the simple, one-syllable words further:

- **MEAT**
- **BIG**
- **SUE**
- **CORE**

These words are all simple and one-syllable. Let's see if they fit the pattern:

- **MEAT**: One syllable
- **BIG**: One syllable
- **SUE**: One syllable
- **CORE**: One syllable

This could be a potential solution. The unique characteristic here is that all four words are simple, one-syllable words. Let's propose this as a possible solution:

**MEAT, BIG, SUE, CORE**

If this doesn't fit the pattern, we can try another approach. Let me know if you want to explore a different pattern or if you have any other thoughts!

- **Names**: DEMI (as in Demi Moore), SUE, LADY (as in Lady Gaga), EARLY (as in Early Wynn, a baseball player)
- **Food**: MEAT, CORE (as in apple core), SUBSTANCE (as in food substance), BIG (as in Big Mac)

Let's explore the "Exercise/Fitness" category:

1. **PUSH-UP**: A common exercise.
2. **CORE**: Refers to exercises targeting the core muscles.
3. **THRUST**: Could refer to exercises like hip thrusts.
4. **SPORTS**: Often involves physical activity and exercise.

This seems like a plausible category. Let's go with this combination:

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS SUBSTANCE MEAT LADY DEMI BIG EARLY SPORTS PUSH-UP THRUST SUE CORE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are each a way to do the same thing.

1. **WIRELESS**: This could relate to communication or technology without wires.
2. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to material or essence.
3. **MEAT**: This is a type of food, specifically animal flesh.
4. **LADY**: This refers to a woman or female.
5. **DEMI**: This could mean half or partial, often used in contexts like "demigod" or "demitasse."
6. **BIG**: This describes size, something large.
7. **EARLY**: This refers to time, something happening before the usual or expected time.
8. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games.
9. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.
10. **THRUST**: This means to push or drive with force.
11. **SUE**: This means to take legal action against someone.
12. **CORE**: This refers to the central or most important part of something.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **PUSH-UP** and **THRUST**: Both involve a forceful movement or exertion. They could be ways to exert force or perform a physical action.
- **SUE**: This is a legal action, which doesn't seem to fit with the others.
- **CORE**: This could relate to the central part of something, or in fitness, it could relate to exercises targeting the core muscles.

Let's explore the possibility of physical actions or exercises:

- **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise.
- **THRUST**: A forceful movement, could be part of an exercise routine.
- **CORE**: Could relate to core exercises.
- **SPORTS**: Involves physical activity, could include exercises.

These four words could potentially fit the pattern of being related to physical activity or exercise:

- **PUSH-UP**
- **THRUST**
- **CORE**
- **SPORTS**

Each of these words can be associated with physical exertion or exercise. Let's see if this combination works. If not, we can explore other connections.
