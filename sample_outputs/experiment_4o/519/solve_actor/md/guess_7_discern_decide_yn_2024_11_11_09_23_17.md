## Prompts

system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Based on the notes and the analysis provided, the strongest guess to submit is **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST**. This group of words has a clear connection as they can each be a noun meaning the essential part or essence of something. This fits well with the pattern of synonymous nouns, which is a common type of connection in these puzzles.

The other guesses either have weaker connections or include words that don't fit as cleanly into a single category or connection. Therefore, I recommend submitting **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, THRUST** as a guess for the puzzle. 

If this guess is incorrect, we can then go back to brainstorming other possible connections. But for now, this seems like the most promising option. Good luck!
