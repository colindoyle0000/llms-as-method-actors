You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential connections for the words provided and determine if we have a strong guess to submit.

1. **LADY, SUE, DEMI, EARLY**:
   - **Connection**: These words can be connected to the concept of "name" or "title." "Lady" is a title, "Sue" and "Demi" are names, and "Early" can be a surname. This connection seems plausible because it involves a subtle and unique connection related to names and titles.

2. **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, WIRELESS, EARLY**:
   - **Connection**: These words are parts of a modern fitness routine or lifestyle. "Sports" and "Push-up" relate to physical activity or exercise, "Wireless" could be part of a modern fitness routine with wireless devices, and "Early" relates to early morning workouts. This connection is less direct and seems more like a thematic grouping rather than a specific connection.

3. **BIG**:
   - This word doesn't seem to fit neatly into either of the above connections, which suggests it might belong to a different group or connection.

Given the patterns and examples provided, the first guess (LADY, SUE, DEMI, EARLY) seems to have a more precise and unique connection, as it relates to names and titles, which is a common type of connection in these puzzles. The second guess seems more thematic and less specific, which might not align with the typical New York Times connections puzzle style.

Therefore, my recommendation is to submit the guess:

**LADY, SUE, DEMI, EARLY** - connected by the concept of "name" or "title."

This guess appears to be the strongest option based on the notes provided. If this guess is incorrect, we can then go back to brainstorming other possible connections./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
