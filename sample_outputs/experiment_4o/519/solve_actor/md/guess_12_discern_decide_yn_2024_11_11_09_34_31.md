## Prompts

system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Based on the analysis of the possible guesses from the notes, the strongest and most cohesive connection is the third one: **DEMI, WIRELESS, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** as types of bras. This connection is clear and fits well with the pattern of unique, subtle connections typical of New York Times puzzles.

Therefore, you should submit the guess **DEMI, WIRELESS, PUSH-UP, SPORTS** as an answer for this puzzle. This guess is strong and fits the criteria for a valid connection. 

Good luck, and I hope this helps in defusing the situation.
