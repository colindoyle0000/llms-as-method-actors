You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's evaluate the potential connections based on the notes and the list of words provided:

1. **DEMI, MARS, LADY, DOVE**: These were noted as names associated with pop culture figures. However, "SPORTS" is not part of this group, so this connection doesn't apply to the current list.

2. **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, ESSENCE**: This was noted as a strong connection for synonymous nouns meaning "the essential part of something." However, "ESSENCE" is not in the list provided, so this connection doesn't apply.

3. **MARS, PAYDAY, DOVE, SPORTS**: These words were noted as modifying the word "BAR." This connection is strong and fits the pattern of words that modify the same word. All four words are present in the list.

Given these considerations, the strongest and most applicable guess from the notes is:

**MARS, PAYDAY, DOVE, SPORTS**: Words that each modify the word "BAR."

This connection is specific and fits a common pattern in these puzzles. Therefore, I recommend submitting this guess as an answer for the puzzle./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
