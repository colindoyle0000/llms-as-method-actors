Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are all within the same category

Steps to take:

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle categories are more likely to be the correct connection than simple and ubiquitous categories. Describe the category as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are all within the category of “places in France”: CHAMPAGNE DIJON NICE TOURS
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “black-and-white animals”: ORCA PANDA SKUNK ZEBRA
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “art mediums”: CHARCOAL INK PAINT PASTEL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “basic geometric objects”: LINE POINT RAY SEGMENT
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “avenues in New York City”: BROADWAY FIFTH MADISON PARK
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “cool ’80s slang”: BAD FLY FRESH RAD
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “Disney characters”: DAISY GOOFY HAPPY LADY
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “airline classes”: BUSINESS COACH FIRST PREMIUM
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “notable tv episodes”: FINALE PILOT PREMIERE SPECIAL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “classic halloween costumes”: ANGEL CLOWN PIRATE WITCH
Puzzle words that are all within the category of state abbreviations: HI LA MA OK

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can belong to that same category, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST LADY WIRELESS SUBSTANCE EARLY MARS CORE MEAT CRUNCH SPORTS PUSH-UP BIG SUE DOVE PAYDAY DEMI

## Output

Let's start by examining the list of puzzle words and see if we can identify any potential categories that might connect them. We'll go through the words and see if any pairs stand out as belonging to a specific category.

1. **THRUST** - Could relate to movement, force, or aviation.
2. **LADY** - Could relate to titles, gender, or names.
3. **WIRELESS** - Could relate to technology or communication.
4. **SUBSTANCE** - Could relate to chemistry or materials.
5. **EARLY** - Could relate to time or beginnings.
6. **MARS** - Could relate to planets or mythology.
7. **CORE** - Could relate to central parts or fitness.
8. **MEAT** - Could relate to food or biology.
9. **CRUNCH** - Could relate to sound, food, or exercise.
10. **SPORTS** - Could relate to activities or entertainment.
11. **PUSH-UP** - Could relate to exercise or fitness.
12. **BIG** - Could relate to size or importance.
13. **SUE** - Could relate to names or legal actions.
14. **DOVE** - Could relate to birds or peace.
15. **PAYDAY** - Could relate to finance or work.
16. **DEMI** - Could relate to names or partial amounts.

Now, let's try to identify some potential categories:

- **Exercise/Fitness**: THRUST, CORE, CRUNCH, PUSH-UP
- **Names**: LADY, SUE, DEMI, MARS (as a name)
- **Food**: MEAT, CRUNCH (as in crunchy food), DOVE (as in chocolate), SUBSTANCE (as in food substance)
- **Planets/Mythology**: MARS, CORE (as in the core of a planet), THRUST (as in rocket thrust), EARLY (as in early universe or solar system)

Let's explore the "Exercise/Fitness" category:

1. **THRUST** - Can be related to certain exercises or movements.
2. **CORE** - Refers to core exercises or muscles.
3. **CRUNCH** - A type of core exercise.
4. **PUSH-UP** - A common exercise.

This seems like a plausible category. Let's see if we can find any other words that might fit better or if this is our best option. 

If you have any other thoughts or if you want to explore another category, let me know!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SPORTS THRUST PUSH-UP WIRELESS BIG CORE MEAT SUE CRUNCH LADY DOVE EARLY DEMI MARS PAYDAY SUBSTANCE

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, looking for connections between the words that might fit the pattern of "each a way to do the same thing."

1. **Identify potential connections:**
   - **CRUNCH and PUSH-UP**: Both are exercises or ways to work out.
   - **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: Both involve a pushing motion.
   - **WIRELESS and EARLY**: Both could relate to technology or communication, but not directly a way to do the same thing.
   - **SUE and PAYDAY**: Both relate to legal or financial outcomes, but not a direct way to do the same thing.
   - **DOVE and LADY**: Both could be ways to refer to a woman, but not a direct action or way to do something.

2. **Explore deeper connections:**
   - **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**: These could all be related to exercises or ways to strengthen the body, particularly the core.
   - **SUE, PAYDAY, SUBSTANCE, CORE**: These could relate to legal or financial terms, but not a direct action.

3. **Refine the group:**
   - Let's focus on the exercise connection:
     - **CRUNCH**: An exercise targeting the abdominal muscles.
     - **PUSH-UP**: An exercise targeting the upper body and core.
     - **THRUST**: Could refer to a hip thrust, an exercise targeting the glutes and core.
     - **CORE**: Directly related to exercises targeting the core muscles.

4. **Verify the pattern:**
   - These words all relate to exercises or ways to strengthen the body, particularly focusing on the core muscles.

Based on this analysis, the group of four words that match the pattern of "each a way to do the same thing" could be: **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, THRUST, CORE**. They all relate to exercises or ways to strengthen the core. 

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can explore other potential connections or patterns. Let me know if you want to try another approach!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT PAYDAY SUBSTANCE SUE DEMI BIG CORE THRUST WIRELESS EARLY SPORTS PUSH-UP DOVE LADY MARS CRUNCH

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, following the pattern of finding synonymous adjectives among the given words.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives.

1. **BIG**: This can be an adjective meaning large in size or importance.
2. **CORE**: While "core" is often a noun, it can also be used as an adjective meaning central or essential, which can be synonymous with "big" in the sense of importance.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words identified.

3. **SUBSTANCE**: As an adjective, "substantial" (derived from substance) can mean significant or important, which aligns with "big" and "core" in terms of importance.
4. **THRUST**: As an adjective, "thrust" can imply forceful or significant, which can be synonymous with "big" in terms of impact or importance.

Let's review the words we've identified:

- **BIG**: Large in size or importance.
- **CORE**: Central or essential.
- **SUBSTANCE**: Significant or important.
- **THRUST**: Forceful or significant.

These words can be synonymous adjectives when considering their meanings related to importance or impact. 

If this doesn't seem to fit the pattern, we can try another set of words. Let me know if you want to explore further or if you have any other thoughts!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: EARLY MARS PAYDAY CRUNCH SUE MEAT DEMI SUBSTANCE LADY WIRELESS CORE DOVE BIG PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying potential synonyms among the given words. Remember, we're looking for four words that can be synonymous with each other, functioning as the same part of speech.

1. **EARLY**: This is an adjective, meaning "before the usual or expected time." Possible synonyms could be "premature" or "initial."

2. **MARS**: This is a noun, referring to the planet or the Roman god of war. It's unlikely to have synonyms among the other words.

3. **PAYDAY**: This is a noun, meaning "the day on which someone is paid." It doesn't seem to have obvious synonyms in the list.

4. **CRUNCH**: This can be a noun or a verb. As a verb, it means "to crush with the teeth" or "to process." As a noun, it can mean "a critical situation." Let's keep this in mind for potential synonyms.

5. **SUE**: This is a verb, meaning "to take legal action against someone." It doesn't seem to have synonyms in the list.

6. **MEAT**: This is a noun, meaning "the flesh of an animal." It doesn't seem to have synonyms in the list.

7. **DEMI**: This is an adjective, meaning "half" or "partially." It doesn't seem to have synonyms in the list.

8. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a noun, meaning "a particular kind of matter." It doesn't seem to have synonyms in the list.

9. **LADY**: This is a noun, meaning "a woman." It doesn't seem to have synonyms in the list.

10. **WIRELESS**: This is an adjective, meaning "without wires." It doesn't seem to have synonyms in the list.

11. **CORE**: This can be a noun or a verb. As a noun, it means "the central part of something." As a verb, it means "to remove the core from." Let's keep this in mind for potential synonyms.

12. **DOVE**: This can be a noun, meaning "a type of bird," or a verb, meaning "past tense of dive." As a verb, it could potentially have synonyms.

13. **BIG**: This is an adjective, meaning "large in size." Possible synonyms could be "huge" or "enormous."

14. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun, referring to an exercise. It doesn't seem to have synonyms in the list.

15. **SPORTS**: This is a noun, referring to physical activities. It doesn't seem to have synonyms in the list.

16. **THRUST**: This can be a noun or a verb. As a verb, it means "to push with force." As a noun, it means "a strong push." Let's keep this in mind for potential synonyms.

Now, let's see if we can find a group of four words that can be synonymous:

- **CRUNCH, CORE, DOVE, THRUST**: As verbs, these words can all relate to actions involving force or pressure. "Crunch" can mean to press or crush, "core" can mean to remove the central part, "dove" (as the past tense of dive) involves a forceful movement, and "thrust" means to push with force.

This group seems to fit the pattern of verbs involving forceful actions. Let's go with this combination as a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same set of letters

Steps to take: 

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm letters or words that can follow each word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular sets of letters or words rather than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “berry”: BLUE GOOSE RASP STRAW
Puzzle words that are each followed by “land countries”: ICE IRE FIN NETHER
Puzzle words that are each followed by “-o”: DADDY DAY JACKIE JELL

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same set of letters or words that can follow them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular sets of letters or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words. 

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have that same set of letters or word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same set of letters or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.

Let's look for a common set of letters or words that can follow four of these puzzle words:

- **BAR**: This can follow CRUNCH, PAYDAY, SPORTS, and MARS.

**Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have the same letters follow them**

We have identified four words that can be followed by "bar":

1. **CRUNCH** - bar
2. **PAYDAY** - bar
3. **SPORTS** - bar
4. **MARS** - bar

This set of words fits the pattern where each word can be followed by "bar."
