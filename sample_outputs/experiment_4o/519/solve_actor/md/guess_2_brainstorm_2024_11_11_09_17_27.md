Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are different aspects of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. Describe the connection between the puzzle words as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Words that are each different aspects of the sharpness as of an image: CLARITY DEFINITION DETAIL RESOLUTION
Words that are each different aspects of plant growths: BLOOM BUD SHOOT SPROUT
Words that are each different aspects of bee creations: COMB HIVE HONEY WAX
Words that are each different aspects of movie summary info: CAST GENRE PLOT TITLE
Words that are each different aspects of sheet music: CLEF NOTE REST STAFF
Words that are each different aspects of solar emanations: CORONA FLARE LIGHT RADIATION

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be different aspects of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing, start over at Step 1.



If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT CORE WIRELESS CRUNCH PUSH-UP SPORTS SUE LADY PAYDAY BIG EARLY DEMI MARS SUBSTANCE DOVE THRUST

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying connections between the words that could represent different aspects of the same thing.

1. **MEAT**: This could refer to the edible flesh of animals, or metaphorically, the core or substance of something.

2. **CORE**: This can mean the central or most important part of something, similar to the core of an apple or the core of an idea.

3. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without physical connections, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

4. **CRUNCH**: This could refer to a sound or action, like crunching numbers or a crunch in exercise.

5. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise focusing on upper body strength.

6. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games, often competitive.

7. **SUE**: This means to bring a legal action against someone.

8. **LADY**: This is a term for a woman, often used to denote respect.

9. **PAYDAY**: This is the day on which someone receives their salary.

10. **BIG**: This is an adjective describing size or importance.

11. **EARLY**: This refers to something happening before the expected time.

12. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning half or partial, often used in terms like "demigod."

13. **MARS**: This is the name of a planet, or it could refer to the Roman god of war.

14. **SUBSTANCE**: This refers to the material or essential part of something.

15. **DOVE**: This is a type of bird, or it could symbolize peace.

16. **THRUST**: This refers to a forceful push or drive.

Now, let's try to find a group of four words that are different aspects of the same thing:

- **MEAT, CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST**: These could all relate to the essential or central part of something. "Meat" and "substance" can both refer to the core or main part of an idea or argument. "Core" is directly the central part, and "thrust" can metaphorically mean the main point or driving force behind something.

This is one possible grouping. Let's consider if there are other potential connections:

- **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, WIRELESS**: These could relate to aspects of fitness or exercise. "Sports" is the general category, "push-up" is a specific exercise, "crunch" is another exercise, and "wireless" could refer to technology used in modern fitness tracking.

If these don't seem to fit, we can explore other combinations or start over with a new pattern. Let me know if you want to explore further or if you have any other ideas!

Pattern: Puzzle words that share a pop culture reference

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle pop culture references are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious pop culture references. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words share a pop culture reference.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the name of jazz legends: HANCOCK HOLIDAY MONK PARKER
Puzzle words that are each last names of superheroes: BANNER PRINCE STARK WAYNE

Puzzle words that are each the last name of a pop megastar: GRANDE MARS STYLES SWIFT
Puzzle words that are each rooms in the game clue: HALL LIBRARY LOUNGE STUDY
Puzzle words that are each lands at Disneyland: ADVENTURE FANTASY FRONTIER TOMORROW

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by sharing the same pop culture reference. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: PAYDAY BIG DEMI DOVE SUE CORE MEAT LADY THRUST MARS CRUNCH PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE EARLY WIRELESS SPORTS

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, looking for potential pop culture references that could connect four of these words.

1. **PAYDAY, CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, BIG**: These are all names of candy bars. PAYDAY is a caramel and peanut bar, CRUNCH is a chocolate bar with crisped rice, PUSH-UP is a frozen treat, and BIG could refer to the BIG HUNK candy bar.

2. **DEMI, MARS, LADY, DOVE**: These could be names associated with pop culture figures. DEMI could refer to Demi Lovato or Demi Moore, MARS could refer to Bruno Mars, LADY could refer to Lady Gaga, and DOVE could refer to the Dove brand or the actress Dove Cameron.

3. **WIRELESS, SPORTS, CORE, EARLY**: These could be related to technology or media. WIRELESS could refer to wireless technology, SPORTS could refer to sports channels or networks, CORE could refer to Apple Core technology, and EARLY could refer to early adopters or early access.

4. **SUE, DEMI, MARS, LADY**: These could be names of characters or people. SUE could refer to Sue Sylvester from "Glee," DEMI could refer to Demi Lovato, MARS could refer to Bruno Mars, and LADY could refer to Lady Gaga.

5. **THRUST, CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT**: These could be related to physical or scientific concepts. THRUST is a force, CORE could refer to the core of a planet or body, SUBSTANCE is a type of matter, and MEAT is a type of substance.

Let's focus on the most promising connection:

- **DEMI, MARS, LADY, DOVE**: These are all names associated with pop culture figures. DEMI Lovato, Bruno MARS, LADY Gaga, and DOVE Cameron. This seems like a strong connection as they are all well-known figures in the entertainment industry.

This group seems to fit the pattern of sharing a pop culture reference. If this doesn't work, we can explore other combinations. Let me know if you need further assistance or if we should try another pattern.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can mean the same thing. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can mean the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can mean the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: EARLY SPORTS CRUNCH SUE LADY DOVE MARS SUBSTANCE BIG WIRELESS PAYDAY DEMI THRUST PUSH-UP CORE MEAT

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying words that can mean the same thing and function as the same part of speech.

1. **EARLY**: This can mean "before the usual time" or "premature." It could be an adjective or adverb depending on context.

2. **SPORTS**: This is typically a noun referring to physical activities or games.

3. **CRUNCH**: This can be a noun meaning "a critical situation" or a verb meaning "to crush noisily."

4. **SUE**: This is a verb meaning "to take legal action against someone."

5. **LADY**: This is a noun meaning "a woman."

6. **DOVE**: This can be a noun referring to a bird or a verb, the past tense of "dive."

7. **MARS**: This can be a noun referring to the planet or a verb meaning "to damage."

8. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a noun meaning "material" or "essence."

9. **BIG**: This is an adjective meaning "large."

10. **WIRELESS**: This is an adjective meaning "without wires" or a noun referring to wireless technology.

11. **PAYDAY**: This is a noun meaning "the day on which one receives payment."

12. **DEMI**: This is an adjective meaning "half" or "partially."

13. **THRUST**: This can be a noun meaning "a strong push" or a verb meaning "to push forcefully."

14. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun referring to an exercise.

15. **CORE**: This can be a noun meaning "the central part" or an adjective meaning "central."

16. **MEAT**: This is a noun meaning "flesh" or "substance."

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **CRUNCH, THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE**: These can all relate to physical exercise or fitness terms. However, "push-up" is more specific as an exercise, while the others can be broader.

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CRUNCH, MARS**: If we consider verbs, "thrust" and "push-up" (as a verb form) can mean to push forcefully, "crunch" can mean to crush or press, and "mars" can mean to damage or press down upon.

- **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, ESSENCE**: These can all be nouns meaning "the essential part of something."

- **EARLY, DEMI, BIG, LADY**: These are adjectives, but they don't share a common meaning.

- **SUE, MARS, CRUNCH, THRUST**: As verbs, "sue" and "mars" don't align with "crunch" and "thrust."

Let's focus on the strongest connection:

- **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, ESSENCE**: These can all be nouns meaning "the essential part of something."

This seems like a plausible group of four words that match the pattern. If this doesn't work, we can try another approach. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can each be a part of a different word within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories. As precisely as possible, describe how each of the two puzzle words can be part of a different word within the same category.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DOVE WIRELESS MEAT THRUST PAYDAY BIG CORE LADY SUE DEMI CRUNCH PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE SPORTS MARS EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying a category that can link four of these words together. 

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **DOVE** and **WIRELESS**: 
   - DOVE can be part of "Dove soap" (a brand).
   - WIRELESS can be part of "Wireless headphones" (a type of electronic device).

These don't seem to fit a specific category together, so let's try another pair.

2. **MEAT** and **THRUST**:
   - MEAT can be part of "Meat grinder" (a kitchen appliance).
   - THRUST can be part of "Thrust washer" (a mechanical component).

These also don't seem to fit a specific category together. Let's try another pair.

3. **PAYDAY** and **BIG**:
   - PAYDAY can be part of "Payday loan" (a financial term).
   - BIG can be part of "Big bank" (also a financial term).

These seem to fit within the financial category. Let's see if we can find more words that fit this category.

### Step 2: Find More Words in the Same Category

4. **CORE**:
   - CORE can be part of "Core inflation" (a financial term).

5. **LADY**:
   - LADY can be part of "Lady luck" (a term often used in gambling, which is related to finance).

6. **SUE**:
   - SUE can be part of "Sue for damages" (a legal term, which can be related to financial settlements).

7. **DEMI**:
   - DEMI doesn't seem to fit the financial category.

8. **CRUNCH**:
   - CRUNCH can be part of "Credit crunch" (a financial term).

9. **PUSH-UP**:
   - PUSH-UP doesn't seem to fit the financial category.

10. **SUBSTANCE**:
    - SUBSTANCE doesn't seem to fit the financial category.

11. **SPORTS**:
    - SPORTS doesn't seem to fit the financial category.

12. **MARS**:
    - MARS doesn't seem to fit the financial category.

13. **EARLY**:
    - EARLY can be part of "Early withdrawal" (a financial term).

### Conclusion

Based on the financial category, we can form a group of four words: PAYDAY, BIG, CORE, and CRUNCH. These words can all be part of terms related to finance:

- Payday loan
- Big bank
- Core inflation
- Credit crunch

This seems to be a plausible solution to the puzzle. If this doesn't work, we can try identifying another category or pattern. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each modify the same word

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that each puzzle word can modify. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words rather than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each modify “pepper”: BELL BLACK DR GHOST
Puzzle words that each modify “trap”: BEAR SAND SPEED TOURIST
Puzzle words that each modify “hour”: AMATEUR ELEVENTH HAPPY RUSH
Puzzle words that each modify “dream”: AMERICAN FEVER LUCID PIPE
Puzzle words that each modify “bat”: BASEBALL CRICKET FRUIT VAMPIRE

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can each modify the same word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so a unique and particular word being modified is more likely to be correct than a generic and ubiquitous word.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can modify that same word. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each modify the same word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that each modify the same word, start over at Step 2.

- **MEAT BAR**: Not a common term.
- **MARS BAR**: Yes, a type of candy.
- **PAYDAY BAR**: Yes, a type of candy.
- **DOVE BAR**: Yes, a type of soap or chocolate.

We have three words that modify "BAR": MARS, PAYDAY, DOVE. We need one more.

So, the four words that can modify "BAR" are: MARS, PAYDAY, DOVE, SPORTS.

**Conclusion:**

The group of four puzzle words that each modify the same word "BAR" are: MARS, PAYDAY, DOVE, SPORTS. 

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or combination. Let me know if you need further assistance!
