You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully evaluate the possible guesses from the notes and see if any align with the patterns typically found in New York Times connections puzzles.

1. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**: This guess is mentioned twice in the notes. The connection here is that all these words relate to exercise and physical activity. "Push-up" and "core" are directly related to exercises, "thrust" can be a movement in exercises, and "sports" is a general category that includes physical activities. This connection seems strong because it fits the pattern of words being related to the same category or activity.

2. **MEAT, BIG, SUE, CORE**: The connection suggested here is that these are all simple, one-syllable words. However, this connection is too straightforward and doesn't fit the typical New York Times puzzle pattern, which usually involves more subtle or unique connections.

3. **PUSH-UP, CORE, THRUST, SPORTS**: This is essentially the same as the first guess, just reordered. The connection remains strong for the same reasons.

Given the analysis, the strongest viable guess is **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**. This guess has a clear and logical connection related to exercise and physical activity, which fits the pattern of New York Times connections puzzles.

Therefore, my recommendation is to submit the guess **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**. This guess seems to be the most promising based on the notes provided. If this guess is incorrect, we can then go back to brainstorming other possible connections./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
