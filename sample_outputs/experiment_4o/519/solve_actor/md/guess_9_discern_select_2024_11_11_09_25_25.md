You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's analyze the potential connections for the words provided and see if any of the guesses from the notes are strong enough to submit:

1. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**:
   - The proposed connection was that these words are each one letter away from words related to physical activities or exercises. However, this connection was weak and forced, especially with the transformation of "CORE" to "CURE."

2. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT**:
   - The proposed connection was that these words all relate to the concept of "essence" or "central part." This connection is strong and coherent, as each word clearly relates to the idea of an "essence" or "central part."

Given the analysis, the second option, **CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT**, is the strongest viable guess. It has a clear and logical connection that fits well with the pattern of finding subtle and unique connections between words. Therefore, I would recommend submitting this guess.

If you are confident in this connection, it would be a good idea to submit it as one of the answers to the puzzle. If not, we can continue brainstorming other possible connections. However, based on the information provided, the second option seems like a strong candidate./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
