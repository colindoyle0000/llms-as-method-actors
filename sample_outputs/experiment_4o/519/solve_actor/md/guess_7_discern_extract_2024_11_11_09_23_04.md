You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best brainstormers have been writing down every thought that comes into their head about how to solve this puzzle. Your job is to look over their notes and copy from each note each possible solution that a brainstormer has identified, along with the brainstormer’s explanation of the connection between the words in that solution.

 

Here are the brainstormers’ notes:


 ## Brainstorming Note #1 
 
Let's tackle this step by step, looking for potential pop culture references that could connect four of these words.

1. **SUE and DEMI**: Both could be first names of famous people. Sue could refer to Sue Storm from the Fantastic Four, and Demi could refer to Demi Moore, the actress. However, this connection doesn't seem strong enough to find two more words.

2. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: These words could relate to something scientific or technological, but it's hard to find a pop culture reference that ties them together with other words.

3. **WIRELESS and SPORTS**: These could relate to modern technology and broadcasting, but again, it's difficult to find a pop culture reference that ties them together with other words.

4. **BIG and LADY**: These could refer to famous songs or artists. "Big" could refer to The Notorious B.I.G., and "Lady" could refer to Lady Gaga. Let's see if we can find two more words that fit this theme.

5. **PUSH-UP and EARLY**: These could relate to fitness or routines, but it's hard to find a pop culture reference that ties them together with other words.

6. **THRUST and MEAT**: These could relate to cooking or grilling, but again, it's difficult to find a pop culture reference that ties them together with other words.

7. **DEMI and LADY**: Both could refer to famous female artists. Demi could refer to Demi Lovato, and Lady could refer to Lady Gaga. Let's see if we can find two more words that fit this theme.

8. **BIG, LADY, DEMI, and EARLY**: This could be a potential group. "Big" for The Notorious B.I.G., "Lady" for Lady Gaga, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, and "Early" could refer to something like Early Morning shows or songs. However, "Early" feels like a stretch here.

Let's try to refine this further:

- **BIG, LADY, DEMI, and SUE**: This could be a group of first names of famous people. "Big" for The Notorious B.I.G., "Lady" for Lady Gaga, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, and "Sue" for Sue Storm. However, "Sue" feels a bit out of place.

- **BIG, LADY, DEMI, and CORE**: This could be a group of words related to music. "Big" for The Notorious B.I.G., "Lady" for Lady Gaga, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, and "Core" could refer to a music genre like Hardcore. However, "Core" feels a bit out of place.

It seems like we're struggling to find a strong connection with four words. Let's try another approach:

- **BIG, LADY, DEMI, and SPORTS**: This could be a group of words related to entertainment. "Big" for The Notorious B.I.G., "Lady" for Lady Gaga, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, and "Sports" for ESPN or sports entertainment. However, "Sports" feels a bit out of place.

It seems like we're having difficulty finding a strong connection with four words. Let's try another pattern or set of words. If you have any other ideas or want to explore a different angle, let me know!

 ## Brainstorming Note #2 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying words that can mean the same thing and function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can mean the same thing.

1. **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can be nouns meaning the essential part or essence of something.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also mean the same thing.

- **MEAT**: This can also be a noun meaning the essential part or substance of something, often used metaphorically (e.g., "the meat of the argument").
- **THRUST**: As a noun, it can mean the main point or essence of something, similar to "core" or "substance."

So, we have a potential group of four words:

- CORE
- SUBSTANCE
- MEAT
- THRUST

Each of these words can function as a noun meaning the essential part or essence of something.

Let's verify if this group fits the pattern:

- CORE: The central or most important part.
- SUBSTANCE: The essential nature or most important part of something.
- MEAT: The essential or most important part of something.
- THRUST: The main point or essence of an argument or discussion.

This group seems to fit the pattern well. If you think this is a viable solution, we can proceed with it. If not, we can explore other combinations. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

 ## Brainstorming Note #3 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying a category that can link four of these words together. 

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **DEMI**: This could be part of the word "demigod" or "demiglace." 
2. **CORE**: This could be part of the word "coreopsis" (a type of flower) or "coreboard."

Let's see if we can find a category that links these two words. 

### Step 2: Explore Categories

- **DEMI** and **CORE** could both relate to the category of **fitness**:
  - **DEMI**: "Demi-squat" (a type of squat exercise)
  - **CORE**: "Core workout" (a type of exercise focusing on the core muscles)

Let's see if other words can fit into this category:

3. **PUSH-UP**: Clearly fits into the fitness category as a type of exercise.
4. **THRUST**: Could relate to "thrust exercise" or "hip thrust," which is a common exercise.

### Step 3: Verify the Category

The category of **fitness exercises** seems to fit well:

- **DEMI**: Demi-squat
- **CORE**: Core workout
- **PUSH-UP**: Push-up exercise
- **THRUST**: Hip thrust exercise

This group of words fits the pattern of being parts of different words within the same category of fitness exercises. 

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can explore other categories or combinations. Let me know if you want to try another approach or if this solution works!

 ## Brainstorming Note #4 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by examining each word and brainstorming possible words they could modify. We need to find a common word that can be modified by four of the puzzle words.

1. **PUSH-UP**: 
   - Could modify "bra" (push-up bra)
   - Could modify "exercise" (push-up exercise)

2. **DEMI**:
   - Could modify "moore" (Demi Moore)
   - Could modify "glace" (demi-glace)
   - Could modify "god" (demi-god)

3. **MEAT**:
   - Could modify "market" (meat market)
   - Could modify "pie" (meat pie)
   - Could modify "loaf" (meat loaf)

4. **THRUST**:
   - Could modify "stage" (thrust stage)
   - Could modify "vector" (thrust vector)

5. **WIRELESS**:
   - Could modify "network" (wireless network)
   - Could modify "router" (wireless router)

6. **CORE**:
   - Could modify "strength" (core strength)
   - Could modify "values" (core values)

7. **SPORTS**:
   - Could modify "car" (sports car)
   - Could modify "team" (sports team)

8. **LADY**:
   - Could modify "gaga" (Lady Gaga)
   - Could modify "bug" (ladybug)

9. **SUE**:
   - Could modify "storm" (Sue Storm)
   - Could modify "grafton" (Sue Grafton)

10. **SUBSTANCE**:
    - Could modify "abuse" (substance abuse)
    - Could modify "painter" (substance painter)

11. **BIG**:
    - Could modify "bang" (big bang)
    - Could modify "deal" (big deal)

12. **EARLY**:
    - Could modify "bird" (early bird)
    - Could modify "morning" (early morning)

Now, let's try to find a common word that can be modified by four of these puzzle words:

- **CORE**: 
  - Could be modified by "PUSH-UP" (push-up core), "WIRELESS" (wireless core), "SPORTS" (sports core), and "DEMI" (demi-core).

- **STAGE**:
  - Could be modified by "THRUST" (thrust stage), "LADY" (lady stage), "BIG" (big stage), and "EARLY" (early stage).

- **MARKET**:
  - Could be modified by "MEAT" (meat market), "WIRELESS" (wireless market), "SPORTS" (sports market), and "LADY" (lady market).

- **CAR**:
  - Could be modified by "SPORTS" (sports car), "BIG" (big car), "WIRELESS" (wireless car), and "LADY" (lady car).

From these options, the most promising seems to be "CORE" with the words "PUSH-UP," "WIRELESS," "SPORTS," and "DEMI." However, "demi-core" is not a common term, so this might not be the correct solution.

Let's try another approach:

- **NETWORK**:
  - Could be modified by "WIRELESS" (wireless network), "CORE" (core network), "SPORTS" (sports network), and "SUBSTANCE" (substance network).

This seems more plausible. Let's go with "NETWORK" as the word being modified by "WIRELESS," "CORE," "SPORTS," and "SUBSTANCE."

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or combination. Let me know if you need further assistance!

 ## Brainstorming Note #5 
 
Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, looking for subtle connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are each a kind of the same thing.

1. **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: Both of these words can be related to exercises or movements. However, they don't immediately suggest a broader category that includes four words.

2. **EARLY and DEMI**: These words don't seem to have a direct connection.

3. **SPORTS and WIRELESS**: These words don't seem to have a direct connection.

4. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: Both of these words can relate to the central or essential part of something. However, they don't immediately suggest a broader category that includes four words.

5. **BIG and LADY**: These words don't seem to have a direct connection.

6. **SUE and DEMI**: These words don't seem to have a direct connection.

7. **MEAT**: This word stands alone without an immediate connection to others.

Let's try to find a more subtle connection:

- **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, and WIRELESS**: This is a bit of a stretch, but if we think of "core" as the central part, "substance" as the essential material, "meat" as the main part of a meal, and "wireless" as a type of technology, they all relate to the idea of being central or essential in their respective contexts. However, "wireless" doesn't fit as neatly.

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, and CORE**: These words can all relate to physical activity or fitness. "Thrust" and "push-up" are movements, "sports" is a category of physical activities, and "core" is often used in fitness to refer to exercises targeting the central muscles of the body.

This last group seems to be the most promising connection. Let's go with:

**THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**: Each of these words can be related to physical activity or fitness.

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or set of words. Let me know if you need further assistance!
