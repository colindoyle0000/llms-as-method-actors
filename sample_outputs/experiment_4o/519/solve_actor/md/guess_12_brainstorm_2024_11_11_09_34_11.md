Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can mean the same thing. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can mean the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can mean the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “how fast something is going”: CLIP PACE RATE SPEED
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to fail to attend”: CUT DITCH MISS SKIP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to become aware of”: DISCOVER FIND LEARN REALIZE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to apply pressure to”: CRUSH MASH PRESS SQUASH
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to chat informally”: GAB JAW YAK YAP
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “pretense”: AFFECT AIRS CHARADE FRONT
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “foolishness”: ABSURDITY FOLLY MADNESS NONSENSE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to move forward”: ADVANCE MARCH PROGRESS PUSH
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to get smaller”: CONTRACT LESSEN REDUCE SHRINK
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to criticize”: BLAST KNOCK SLAM TRASH

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also mean the same thing as the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can mean the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can mean the same thing, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS LADY SPORTS SUE BIG PUSH-UP DEMI EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding words that can mean the same thing and function as the same part of speech.

1. **WIRELESS**: This can be a noun referring to a type of communication technology, but it can also be an adjective describing something that operates without wires.

2. **LADY**: This is a noun meaning a woman.

3. **SPORTS**: This is a noun referring to physical activities or games, but it can also be a verb meaning to wear or display something.

4. **SUE**: This is a verb meaning to initiate legal proceedings against someone.

5. **BIG**: This is an adjective meaning large in size.

6. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun referring to a type of exercise, but it can also be an adjective describing a type of bra.

7. **DEMI**: This is an adjective meaning half or partial.

8. **EARLY**: This is an adjective meaning before the usual or expected time.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **WIRELESS** and **SPORTS**: Both can be adjectives. However, they don't share a common meaning.
- **LADY** and **SUE**: No direct connection in meaning.
- **BIG** and **EARLY**: Both are adjectives, but they don't share a common meaning.
- **PUSH-UP** and **DEMI**: Both can be adjectives, but they don't share a common meaning.

Let's try another approach:

- **BIG** and **DEMI**: Both are adjectives that can describe size or extent. "Demi" means partial or half, which is a type of size description, while "big" is a straightforward size description.
- **EARLY**: This can be an adjective describing time, but it doesn't fit with "big" or "demi."
- **PUSH-UP**: As an adjective, it describes a type of bra, which doesn't fit with "big" or "demi."

Let's try another angle:

- **SUE**: As a verb, it means to initiate legal proceedings.
- **SPORTS**: As a verb, it means to wear or display something.

Unfortunately, I'm not finding a clear group of four words that fit the pattern of having the same meaning and functioning as the same part of speech. Let's try another pattern or set of words if this doesn't work.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can each be a part of a different word within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories. As precisely as possible, describe how each of the two puzzle words can be part of a different word within the same category.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the first letters of a zodiac sign: CAN GEM LIB TAU
Puzzle words that are each the first letters of the name of a planet: EAR MAR MER SAT
Puzzle words that each start with letters that form the name of a rock band: CREAMSICLE JOURNEYMAN KISSCAM RUSHMORE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can be part of different words within that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: PUSH-UP WIRELESS SPORTS BIG LADY EARLY DEMI SUE

## Output

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We need to find a category where each of the puzzle words can be part of a different word within that category. Let's start by examining each word and see if we can identify any potential categories.

1. **PUSH-UP**: This could relate to exercise or fitness.
2. **WIRELESS**: This could relate to technology or communication.
3. **SPORTS**: This could relate to activities or games.
4. **BIG**: This could relate to size or magnitude.
5. **LADY**: This could relate to gender or titles.
6. **EARLY**: This could relate to time or schedules.
7. **DEMI**: This could relate to names or measurements (e.g., demi-glace, demi-god).
8. **SUE**: This could relate to legal terms or names.

Now, let's try to find a category that could encompass some of these words:

### Step 1: Identify Two Words

- **PUSH-UP** and **SPORTS**: Both can be related to the category of "Exercise."
  - PUSH-UP is a type of exercise.
  - SPORTS is a category that includes various physical activities.

### Step 2: Find More Words in the Same Category

- **WIRELESS**: Could be a stretch, but if we think of "Wireless Sports Equipment" (like wireless headphones used during exercise), it might fit.
- **BIG**: Could relate to "Big Sports Events" or "Big Exercise Equipment."
- **EARLY**: Could relate to "Early Morning Workouts" or "Early Sports Training."
- **DEMI**: Could relate to "Demi-plié" in ballet, which is a form of exercise.
- **SUE**: This one is tricky, but if we think of "Sue Bird," a famous athlete, it could fit into the sports category.

### Possible Combination

Let's try to form a group of four words:

1. **PUSH-UP**: Exercise
2. **SPORTS**: Exercise/Sports
3. **EARLY**: Early Morning Workouts
4. **DEMI**: Demi-plié (ballet exercise)

This combination seems to fit the category of "Exercise" or "Physical Activities." If this doesn't work, we might need to consider another pattern or category. Let me know if you want to explore another angle or if this seems like a viable solution.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each modify the same word

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that each puzzle word can modify. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words rather than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each modify “pepper”: BELL BLACK DR GHOST
Puzzle words that each modify “trap”: BEAR SAND SPEED TOURIST
Puzzle words that each modify “hour”: AMATEUR ELEVENTH HAPPY RUSH
Puzzle words that each modify “dream”: AMERICAN FEVER LUCID PIPE
Puzzle words that each modify “bat”: BASEBALL CRICKET FRUIT VAMPIRE

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can each modify the same word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so a unique and particular word being modified is more likely to be correct than a generic and ubiquitous word.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can modify that same word. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each modify the same word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that each modify the same word, start over at Step 2.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS SPORTS EARLY PUSH-UP SUE LADY DEMI BIG

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on finding a common word that each of the puzzle words can modify. 

1. **WIRELESS**: This can modify "network" (wireless network), "technology" (wireless technology), or "device" (wireless device).

2. **SPORTS**: This can modify "car" (sports car), "team" (sports team), or "event" (sports event).

3. **EARLY**: This can modify "bird" (early bird), "morning" (early morning), or "stage" (early stage).

4. **PUSH-UP**: This can modify "bra" (push-up bra) or "exercise" (push-up exercise).

5. **SUE**: This can modify "storm" (Sue Storm, a character from the Fantastic Four) or "Grafton" (Sue Grafton, an author).

6. **LADY**: This can modify "bug" (ladybug), "bird" (ladybird), or "gaga" (Lady Gaga).

7. **DEMI**: This can modify "Moore" (Demi Moore, an actress) or "Lovato" (Demi Lovato, a singer).

8. **BIG**: This can modify "deal" (big deal), "bang" (big bang), or "apple" (Big Apple, a nickname for New York City).

Now, let's see if we can find a common word that four of these puzzle words can modify:

- **EARLY**, **LADY**, **BIG**, and **WIRELESS** can all modify "bird":
  - Early bird
  - Ladybird
  - Big bird (a character from Sesame Street)
  - Wireless bird (a bit of a stretch, but could refer to a bird with a tracking device)

This is a potential solution, but let's see if we can find a stronger connection:

- **SPORTS**, **EARLY**, **BIG**, and **WIRELESS** can all modify "event":
  - Sports event
  - Early event
  - Big event
  - Wireless event (an event broadcasted wirelessly)

This seems like a more plausible set. Let's go with this combination: **SPORTS**, **EARLY**, **BIG**, and **WIRELESS** all modify "event". 

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or combination. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each a kind of a thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. Describe the connection between the puzzle words as precisely as possible.

Puzzle words that are each a kind of circular shape: BAND CIRCLE HOOP RING
Puzzle words that are each a kind of place to shop: MALL MARKET OUTLET STORE
Puzzle words that are each a kind of wrench: ALLEN CRESCENT MONKEY SOCKET

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by being a kind of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each a kind of the same thing.

2. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to technology (wireless technology), a type of communication (wireless communication), or a type of bra (wireless bra).

3. **SUE**: This could refer to a legal action (to sue someone), a name (Sue), or a type of dinosaur (Sue the T. rex).

4. **PUSH-UP**: This could refer to an exercise (push-up), a type of bra (push-up bra), or a type of ice cream (push-up pop).

8. **SPORTS**: This could refer to activities (sports), a type of bra (sports bra), or a type of car (sports car).

Now, let's see if we can find a group of four words that are each a kind of the same thing:

- **DEMI**, **WIRELESS**, **PUSH-UP**, **SPORTS**: These are all types of bras. 

This seems to be a plausible connection. Each of these words can describe a type of bra:

- **Demi bra**
- **Wireless bra**
- **Push-up bra**
- **Sports bra**

This group of four words fits the pattern of being each a kind of the same thing. If this is the correct solution, it would mean we've successfully identified the pattern. If not, we can try another approach. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous nouns.

Examples from prior puzzles:

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS SUE DEMI BIG LADY SPORTS EARLY PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential synonymous nouns among the given words: WIRELESS, SUE, DEMI, BIG, LADY, SPORTS, EARLY, PUSH-UP.

1. **WIRELESS**: As a noun, "wireless" can refer to a radio or a wireless communication device. However, it's not commonly synonymous with any of the other words in the list.

2. **SUE**: As a noun, "sue" doesn't have a common usage. It's primarily a verb meaning to initiate legal proceedings.

3. **DEMI**: As a noun, "demi" is not commonly used. It can refer to a half-size or a small portion, but it's not a strong candidate for a synonym with the other words.

4. **BIG**: As a noun, "big" doesn't have a common usage. It's primarily an adjective.

5. **LADY**: As a noun, "lady" can mean a woman or a female of authority or distinction. Let's see if it can pair with any other words.

6. **SPORTS**: As a noun, "sports" refers to physical activities or games. It doesn't seem to pair with the other words.

7. **EARLY**: As a noun, "early" doesn't have a common usage. It's primarily an adjective.

8. **PUSH-UP**: As a noun, "push-up" refers to a type of exercise. It doesn't seem to pair with the other words.

Given this analysis, let's focus on "LADY" as a potential starting point:

- **LADY**: A woman or female of authority or distinction.

Now, let's see if we can find any other words that could be synonymous with "LADY":

- **DEMI**: In some contexts, "demi" can refer to a "demi-goddess" or a "demi-celebrity," which might loosely connect to "lady" in terms of status or distinction, but it's a stretch.

- **BIG**: In some contexts, "big" can refer to someone important or of high status, which might connect to "lady" in terms of prominence, but again, it's a stretch.

- **EARLY**: No direct connection to "lady."

- **SPORTS**: No direct connection to "lady."

- **WIRELESS**: No direct connection to "lady."

- **SUE**: No direct connection to "lady."

- **PUSH-UP**: No direct connection to "lady."

Unfortunately, it seems challenging to find a group of four words from this list that can be synonymous nouns. The words provided don't seem to have a strong commonality in terms of synonymous noun meanings. We might need to consider a different pattern or approach. Let me know if you want to try another pattern or if there are additional clues or context that might help.
