## Prompts

system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Based on the analysis of the brainstormed notes, the strongest and most coherent connection is found in **Brainstorming Note #5**: **BIG**, **DEMI**, **LADY**, **SUE**. This group is connected through pop culture references, which aligns well with the types of connections typically found in New York Times puzzles. 

The other notes either lack a complete set of four words or have connections that are too vague or not specific enough. Therefore, the best course of action is to submit the guess **BIG**, **DEMI**, **LADY**, **SUE** as it has a clear and specific connection.

Let's submit this guess.

"""

user: Yes = submit a guess. No = go back to brainstorming.

## Output
