You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential guesses from the notes and see if any of them are strong enough to submit:

1. **CORE, THRUST, BIG CRUNCH, MARS**: 
   - This group is related to space or astrophysics. While there is a thematic connection, it might be too broad or not specific enough for a New York Times puzzle, which often requires more subtle or unique connections.

2. **BIG: PUSH-UP, PAYDAY, THRUST, SPORTS**: 
   - Each of these words can commonly follow "BIG": "BIG PUSH-UP," "BIG PAYDAY," "BIG THRUST," "BIG SPORTS." This is a straightforward connection based on a common prefix, which is a typical pattern in these puzzles.

3. **MEAT, CORE, DOVE, MARS**: 
   - These words are each one letter away from words that can be associated with a grocery store or market: "MEAT" (Meet), "CORE" (More), "DOVE" (Love), "MARS" (Cars). This connection is clever but might be a bit too abstract or tenuous compared to the others.

Given these evaluations, the second guess, **BIG: PUSH-UP, PAYDAY, THRUST, SPORTS**, seems to be the strongest choice. It fits well with the pattern of words that can be preceded by the same word, and it's a connection that is both unique and straightforward.

Therefore, I recommend submitting the guess **BIG: PUSH-UP, PAYDAY, THRUST, SPORTS** as an answer for this puzzle. It aligns well with the typical patterns of New York Times connections puzzles and is the most coherent and articulable connection among the options provided./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
