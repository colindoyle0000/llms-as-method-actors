You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Based on the notes and evaluations provided, the strongest connection identified is the "Words Followed by 'Bar'" group: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, SPORTS, MARS. This connection is clear and fits well with the pattern of New York Times connections puzzles, which often involve words that can be followed by the same word or phrase.

Let's review the reasoning:

1. **CRUNCH Bar**: A type of chocolate bar.
2. **PAYDAY Bar**: Another type of candy bar.
3. **SPORTS Bar**: A place where people gather to watch sports, often serving food and drinks.
4. **MARS Bar**: A well-known chocolate bar.

Each of these words can be followed by "bar," making this a strong and straightforward connection. The other potential connections in the notes have weaknesses or ambiguities that make them less suitable for submission.

Given this analysis, I recommend submitting the guess for the "Words Followed by 'Bar'" group: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, SPORTS, MARS. This is the most confident choice based on the information provided./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
