system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully evaluate the potential connections for the words provided and determine if we have a strong guess to submit.

1. **LADY, SUE, DEMI, EARLY**:
   - **Connection**: These words can be connected to the concept of "name" or "title." "Lady" is a title, "Sue" and "Demi" are names, and "Early" can be a surname. This connection seems plausible because it involves a subtle and unique connection related to names and titles.

2. **SPORTS, PUSH-UP, WIRELESS, EARLY**:
   - **Connection**: These words are parts of a modern fitness routine or lifestyle. "Sports" and "Push-up" relate to physical activity or exercise, "Wireless" could be part of a modern fitness routine with wireless devices, and "Early" relates to early morning workouts. This connection is less direct and seems more like a thematic grouping rather than a specific connection.

3. **BIG**:
   - This word doesn't seem to fit neatly into either of the above connections, which suggests it might belong to a different group or connection.

Given the patterns and examples provided, the first guess (LADY, SUE, DEMI, EARLY) seems to have a more precise and unique connection, as it relates to names and titles, which is a common type of connection in these puzzles. The second guess seems more thematic and less specific, which might not align with the typical New York Times connections puzzle style.

Therefore, my recommendation is to submit the guess:

**LADY, SUE, DEMI, EARLY** - connected by the concept of "name" or "title."

This guess appears to be the strongest option based on the notes provided. If this guess is incorrect, we can then go back to brainstorming other possible connections.

"""

user: Yes = submit a guess. No = go back to brainstorming.

## Output

Yes
