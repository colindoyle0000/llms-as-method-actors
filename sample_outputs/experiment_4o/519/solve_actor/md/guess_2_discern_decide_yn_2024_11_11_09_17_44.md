system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's evaluate the potential connections based on the notes and the list of words provided:

1. **DEMI, MARS, LADY, DOVE**: These were noted as names associated with pop culture figures. However, "SPORTS" is not part of this group, so this connection doesn't apply to the current list.

2. **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, ESSENCE**: This was noted as a strong connection for synonymous nouns meaning "the essential part of something." However, "ESSENCE" is not in the list provided, so this connection doesn't apply.

3. **MARS, PAYDAY, DOVE, SPORTS**: These words were noted as modifying the word "BAR." This connection is strong and fits the pattern of words that modify the same word. All four words are present in the list.

Given these considerations, the strongest and most applicable guess from the notes is:

**MARS, PAYDAY, DOVE, SPORTS**: Words that each modify the word "BAR."

This connection is specific and fits a common pattern in these puzzles. Therefore, I recommend submitting this guess as an answer for the puzzle.
