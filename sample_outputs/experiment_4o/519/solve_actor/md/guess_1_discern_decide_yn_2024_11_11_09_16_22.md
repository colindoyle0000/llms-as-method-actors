Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Based on the notes and evaluations provided, the strongest connection identified is the "Words Followed by 'Bar'" group: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, SPORTS, MARS. This connection is clear and fits well with the pattern of New York Times connections puzzles, which often involve words that can be followed by the same word or phrase.

Let's review the reasoning:

1. **CRUNCH Bar**: A type of chocolate bar.
2. **PAYDAY Bar**: Another type of candy bar.
3. **SPORTS Bar**: A place where people gather to watch sports, often serving food and drinks.
4. **MARS Bar**: A well-known chocolate bar.

Each of these words can be followed by "bar," making this a strong and straightforward connection. The other potential connections in the notes have weaknesses or ambiguities that make them less suitable for submission.

Given this analysis, I recommend submitting the guess for the "Words Followed by 'Bar'" group: CRUNCH, PAYDAY, SPORTS, MARS. This is the most confident choice based on the information provided.
