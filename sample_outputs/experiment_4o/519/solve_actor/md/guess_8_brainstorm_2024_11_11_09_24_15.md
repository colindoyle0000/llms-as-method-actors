Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous nouns.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “scheme”: PLOT PLOY RUSE TRICK
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “swindler”: CHEAT CROOK QUACK SHARK
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “curmudgeon”: CRAB CRANK GROUCH GRUMP
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “boldness”: GALL GUTS NERVE STONES
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “brief moment”: FLASH JIFFY SECOND WINK
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “comedian’s output”: BIT JOKE ROUTINE SKETCH
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “little bit” in a recipe: DASH DROP PINCH SPLASH
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “darling”: BABY BOO DEAR LOVE
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “paper” in a book: FOLIO LEAF PAGE SHEET
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “sequence”: CHAIN SERIES STRING TRAIN
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “quarrel”: FIGHT ROW SCRAP TIFF
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “portion of profit”: CUT PIECE SHARE TAKE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE WIRELESS THRUST SPORTS SUBSTANCE CORE PUSH-UP DEMI LADY EARLY BIG MEAT

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, following the pattern of finding synonymous nouns.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous nouns.**

1. **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can be synonymous nouns meaning the essential part or essence of something. 

2. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can be synonymous nouns meaning a forceful push or shove.

3. **LADY** and **DEMI**: Both can be synonymous nouns referring to a woman, though "demi" is less common and typically used in specific contexts like "demi-monde."

4. **BIG** and **MEAT**: Both can be synonymous nouns in the context of something substantial or significant, though "meat" is more metaphorical.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.**

Let's explore each pair to see if we can find a group of four:

1. **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, ESSENCE**: These words can all be synonymous nouns meaning the essential part or essence of something. However, "essence" is not in the list, so this doesn't work.

2. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, DRIVE, FORCE**: These words can all be synonymous nouns meaning a forceful push or drive. However, "drive" and "force" are not in the list, so this doesn't work.

3. **LADY, DEMI, DAME, WOMAN**: These words can all be synonymous nouns referring to a woman. However, "dame" and "woman" are not in the list, so this doesn't work.

4. **BIG, MEAT, CHUNK, BULK**: These words can all be synonymous nouns in the context of something substantial or significant. However, "chunk" and "bulk" are not in the list, so this doesn't work.

It seems we haven't found a group of four words that fit the pattern. Let's try another approach or pattern. If you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern to consider, let me know!

Pattern: Puzzle words that can substitute for each other. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can substitute for each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can substitute for each other.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BIG LADY DEMI EARLY MEAT THRUST WIRELESS SUE SPORTS CORE SUBSTANCE PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that can substitute for each other, functioning as the same part of speech.

1. **BIG**: This is an adjective meaning "large in size or extent."
2. **LADY**: This is a noun meaning "a woman."
3. **DEMI**: This is an adjective meaning "half" or "partial."
4. **EARLY**: This can be an adjective meaning "before the usual or expected time" or an adverb meaning "before the usual time."
5. **MEAT**: This is a noun meaning "the flesh of an animal used as food."
6. **THRUST**: This can be a verb meaning "to push with force" or a noun meaning "a strong push."
7. **WIRELESS**: This is an adjective meaning "without wires" or a noun referring to wireless technology.
8. **SUE**: This is a verb meaning "to bring a legal action against someone."
9. **SPORTS**: This is a noun meaning "physical activities involving skill and competition."
10. **CORE**: This can be a noun meaning "the central or most important part" or a verb meaning "to remove the core of something."
11. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a noun meaning "a particular kind of matter with uniform properties."
12. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun meaning "an exercise involving raising and lowering the body using the arms."

Now, let's identify potential connections:

- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can relate to the action of pushing, though "push-up" is more specific to exercise.
- **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can refer to the essential part of something.
- **BIG** and **DEMI**: Both are adjectives, but they have opposite meanings in terms of size.
- **WIRELESS** and **SPORTS**: Both can be nouns, but they don't share a direct connection in meaning.

Let's focus on the connection between **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP** as verbs related to pushing:

1. **THRUST**: Verb meaning "to push with force."
2. **PUSH-UP**: While primarily a noun, it involves the action of pushing.
3. **SUE**: Verb meaning "to bring a legal action," doesn't fit with the pushing theme.
4. **CORE**: As a verb, it means "to remove the core," which involves a form of pushing or removing.

We need to find a fourth word that fits the pushing theme:

- **THRUST**: Verb meaning "to push with force."
- **PUSH-UP**: Involves the action of pushing.
- **CORE**: As a verb, involves removing or pushing out the core.
- **WIRELESS**: Doesn't fit the theme.
- **SPORTS**: Doesn't fit the theme.
- **SUE**: Doesn't fit the theme.

Unfortunately, it seems we don't have a perfect set of four words that fit the same pattern of pushing. Let's try another approach or pattern if needed.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE DEMI THRUST BIG WIRELESS CORE EARLY SPORTS PUSH-UP LADY MEAT SUBSTANCE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying connections between the puzzle words and different meanings of the same word or letter.

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **SUE** and **DEMI**:
   - **SUE**: Can mean to take legal action against someone.
   - **DEMI**: Can refer to a half or partial amount (as in "demigod" or "demitasse").

2. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**:
   - **THRUST**: Can mean to push something with force.
   - **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise involving pushing the body up from the ground.

3. **BIG** and **LADY**:
   - **BIG**: Can mean large in size.
   - **LADY**: Can refer to a woman or a title of respect.

4. **WIRELESS** and **CORE**:
   - **WIRELESS**: Can refer to technology that operates without wires.
   - **CORE**: Can mean the central or most important part of something.

5. **EARLY** and **SPORTS**:
   - **EARLY**: Can mean happening or done before the usual or expected time.
   - **SPORTS**: Can refer to physical activities involving skill and competition.

6. **MEAT** and **SUBSTANCE**:
   - **MEAT**: Can refer to the flesh of an animal used as food.
   - **SUBSTANCE**: Can mean a particular kind of matter with uniform properties.

### Step 2: Find a Group of Four Words

Let's try to find a common word or letter that connects four of these puzzle words:

- **CORE**: Can mean the central part of something.
- **WIRELESS**: Can refer to technology that operates without wires.
- **THRUST**: Can mean to push something with force.
- **PUSH-UP**: A type of exercise involving pushing the body up from the ground.

These words could potentially connect to the word "center" or "central" in different contexts:
- **CORE**: The central part of something.
- **WIRELESS**: Central to modern communication technology.
- **THRUST**: Central force in physics.
- **PUSH-UP**: Central exercise in fitness routines.

This is a possible solution, but let's consider if there are other combinations:

- **SUE**: Legal action.
- **DEMI**: Half or partial.
- **BIG**: Large in size.
- **LADY**: Woman or title of respect.

These words could potentially connect to the word "title" in different contexts:
- **SUE**: Title of a legal case.
- **DEMI**: Title prefix indicating half.
- **BIG**: Title indicating size or importance.
- **LADY**: Title of respect.

This is another possible solution. If neither of these combinations seems correct, we may need to explore other connections or patterns. Let me know if you want to explore further or if you have any other ideas!

For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can follow each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words and phrases rather than generic and ubiquitous words and phrases.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “George”: BOY BY CURIOUS SAINT
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Valley”: DEATH HIDDEN SILICON UNCANNY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “Crane”: CONSTRUCTION FRASIER PAPER WHOOPING
Puzzle words that are each followed by “up”: AMP FIRE HYPE PUMP
Puzzle words that are each followed by “jam”: NBA PAPER PEARL TRAFFIC
Puzzle words that are each followed by “bear”: BOO-BOO BROWN HONEY TEDDY
Puzzle words that are each followed by “chip”: BLUE COMPUTER POKER POTATO
Puzzle words that are each followed by “wheel”: CHEESE COLOR HAMSTER PRAYER

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same word or phrase that follows them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words and phrases are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same word or phrase. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each followed by the same word or phrase, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CROP CURIOUS BAD TANK GEE FLY BEE FRESH TEE RAD EX JAY BOY POLO BY SAINT

Output:

To tackle this puzzle effectively, let's begin by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **CROP** - dust, circles, top, rotation
- **CURIOUS** - George, case, about, nature
- **BAD** - news, influence, boy, habit
- **TANK** - top, engine, battle, fish
- **GEE** - whiz, thanks, golly, willikers
- **FLY** - swatter, fishing, high, away
- **BEE** - hive, line, pollen, movie
- **FRESH** - air, produce, start, prince
- **TEE** - shirt, time, off, ball
- **RAD** - tech, radiation, cool, level
- **EX** - wife, husband, file, change
- **JAY** - bird, walk, Z, blue
- **BOY** - scout, friend, George, band
- **POLO** - shirt, match, water, club
- **BY** - pass, law, product, George
- **SAINT** - Bernard, Mary, George, Nicholas

### Observations:

Observing a connection here with the word "George", as it follows CURIOUS (from the character Curious George), BOY (from the character Boy George), SAINT (Saint George), and BY (like in a phrase, although a bit of a stretch). Here's a pattern match:

**Pattern:** Words that are each followed by “George”

- CURIOUS
- BOY
- SAINT
- BY

Now, let's test another set of puzzle words:

1. **BAD** - followed by "guy", "habit", "blood", etc.
2. **FRESH** - followed by "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
3. **TANK** - followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
4. **TEE** - followed by "shirt", "time", "off", etc.

No obvious connection stands out here as strongly as the previous one.

Let's try one more grouping:

1. **CROP** - followed by "top", "circle", "dusting", etc.
2. **TANK** - again, followed by "top", "engine", "battle", etc.
3. **FRESH** - mentioned earlier, "air", "produce", "prince", etc.
4. **EX** - followed by "girlfriend", "president", "employee", etc.

Here, the words "CROP" and "TANK" both could follow with "top" (crop top, tank top). However, extending this to four words with the same following phrase doesn't work in this selection.

In conclusion, for this set, the strongest pattern match I found involves:

- **CURIOUS**
- **BOY**
- **SAINT**
- **BY**

All of these can logically be followed by the word "George".

— end of example input and output —


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS MEAT CORE LADY SUBSTANCE EARLY DEMI PUSH-UP THRUST SPORTS BIG SUE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle by analyzing potential phrases that can follow each puzzle word in the list. The objective is to identify any common phrase that can logically append to each puzzle word.

### Initial Brainstorming:

- **WIRELESS** - network, connection, technology, router
- **MEAT** - market, loaf, grinder, pie
- **CORE** - strength, values, temperature, group
- **LADY** - bug, bird, luck, gaga
- **SUBSTANCE** - abuse, use, control, matter
- **EARLY** - bird, riser, morning, adopter
- **DEMI** - god, lovato, moore, tasse
- **PUSH-UP** - bra, exercise, challenge, position
- **THRUST** - vector, stage, force, bearing
- **SPORTS** - car, team, center, drink
- **BIG** - bang, deal, apple, ben
- **SUE** - storm, sylvester, grafton, me

### Observations:

Let's look for a common word or phrase that can follow four of these puzzle words.

1. **WIRELESS** - "network" seems like a strong candidate.
2. **MEAT** - "market" or "loaf" are possibilities.
3. **CORE** - "strength" or "values" could work.
4. **LADY** - "bug" or "gaga" are options.
5. **SUBSTANCE** - "abuse" or "control" are common.
6. **EARLY** - "bird" or "adopter" are typical.
7. **DEMI** - "god" or "lovato" are specific.
8. **PUSH-UP** - "bra" or "challenge" are specific.
9. **THRUST** - "vector" or "force" are technical.
10. **SPORTS** - "car" or "team" are common.
11. **BIG** - "bang" or "apple" are well-known.
12. **SUE** - "storm" or "grafton" are specific.

### Potential Matches:

- **EARLY** and **BIRD**: "Early bird" is a common phrase.
- **LADY** and **BUG**: "Ladybug" is a common term.
- **BIG** and **BANG**: "Big bang" is a well-known concept.
- **SPORTS** and **CAR**: "Sports car" is a common term.

Let's see if we can find a common word that follows four of these:

1. **EARLY** - "bird"
2. **LADY** - "bug"
3. **BIG** - "bang"
4. **SPORTS** - "car"

Unfortunately, these don't share a common following word or phrase. Let's try another approach:

1. **WIRELESS** - "network"
2. **MEAT** - "market"
3. **CORE** - "strength"
4. **SUBSTANCE** - "abuse"

Again, no commonality here. Let's try one more grouping:

1. **DEMI** - "god"
2. **PUSH-UP** - "bra"
3. **THRUST** - "vector"
4. **SUE** - "storm"

No common word or phrase follows these either.

### Conclusion:

For this set, I haven't found a strong pattern match with a common following word or phrase. If you have any other ideas or if we should try another pattern, let me know!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT PUSH-UP SUBSTANCE EARLY SPORTS DEMI WIRELESS BIG THRUST LADY SUE CORE

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, looking for connections between the words that might indicate they are parts of the same thing or process.

1. **MEAT**: This could refer to food, but it might also be part of a phrase or concept.
2. **PUSH-UP**: This is an exercise, but it could also be part of a phrase.
3. **SUBSTANCE**: This is a broad term that could relate to material or essence.
4. **EARLY**: This could refer to time or a stage in a process.
5. **SPORTS**: This is a category of physical activities.
6. **DEMI**: This is a prefix meaning "half" or "partial."
7. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without wires.
8. **BIG**: This is an adjective describing size.
9. **THRUST**: This could refer to force or movement.
10. **LADY**: This is a term for a woman.
11. **SUE**: This could be a name or a legal action.
12. **CORE**: This refers to the central part of something.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can refer to the essential part of something.
- **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both involve force or movement, possibly related to exercise or physical activity.
- **WIRELESS** and **BIG**: These could be part of a technological context, like "big data" and "wireless technology."

Let's try to find a group of four words:

1. **CORE**: Central part of something.
2. **SUBSTANCE**: Essential material or essence.
3. **THRUST**: Force or movement.
4. **PUSH-UP**: Exercise involving movement.

These words could be related to a process involving physical or metaphorical strength and essence, but they don't quite form a coherent group under a single theme. Let's try another angle:

- **DEMI**, **LADY**, **SUE**, **EARLY**: These could be parts of names or titles, but they don't form a clear group.

Let's try another approach:

- **WIRELESS**, **BIG**, **THRUST**, **CORE**: These could relate to technology or innovation, like wireless technology, big data, thrust in engineering, and core technology.

This group seems to have a more coherent connection related to technology and innovation. Let's go with this:

1. **WIRELESS**: Technology without wires.
2. **BIG**: Often used in "big data" in tech contexts.
3. **THRUST**: Can refer to innovation or forward movement in technology.
4. **CORE**: Central technology or essential part of a system.

This group seems to fit the pattern of being parts of the same thing or process, specifically in the context of technology and innovation. Let me know if you think this is a viable solution or if we should explore other possibilities!
