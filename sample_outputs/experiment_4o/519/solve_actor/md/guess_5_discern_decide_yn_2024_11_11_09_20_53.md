## Prompts

system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Based on the notes and analysis provided, the strongest guess to submit is **PAYDAY, MARS, CRUNCH, DOVE**. This group has a clear and specific connection as they are all well-known candy bars. The connection is strong and fits the criteria for a New York Times connections puzzle, as it is unique and specific.

Therefore, I recommend submitting **PAYDAY, MARS, CRUNCH, DOVE** as a guess for the puzzle.

"""

user: Yes = submit a guess. No = go back to brainstorming.
