Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Let's carefully evaluate the possible guesses from the notes and see if any align with the patterns typically found in New York Times connections puzzles.

1. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**: This guess is mentioned twice in the notes. The connection here is that all these words relate to exercise and physical activity. "Push-up" and "core" are directly related to exercises, "thrust" can be a movement in exercises, and "sports" is a general category that includes physical activities. This connection seems strong because it fits the pattern of words being related to the same category or activity.

2. **MEAT, BIG, SUE, CORE**: The connection suggested here is that these are all simple, one-syllable words. However, this connection is too straightforward and doesn't fit the typical New York Times puzzle pattern, which usually involves more subtle or unique connections.

3. **PUSH-UP, CORE, THRUST, SPORTS**: This is essentially the same as the first guess, just reordered. The connection remains strong for the same reasons.

Given the analysis, the strongest viable guess is **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**. This guess has a clear and logical connection related to exercise and physical activity, which fits the pattern of New York Times connections puzzles.

Therefore, my recommendation is to submit the guess **THRUST, PUSH-UP, CORE, SPORTS**. This guess seems to be the most promising based on the notes provided. If this guess is incorrect, we can then go back to brainstorming other possible connections.
