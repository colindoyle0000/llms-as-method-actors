Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous verbs.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to shepherd”: DIRECT GUIDE LEAD STEER
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to contact via phone”: BUZZ CALL DIAL RING
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to separate”: DIVIDE FORK PART SPLIT
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to pester”: BADGER BUG HOUND NAG
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to get low”: CROUCH DUCK SQUAT STOOP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to make happy”: AMUSE DELIGHT PLEASE TICKLE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to reserve for later”: BANK SAVE STASH STORE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to restrain”: CHECK CURB LIMIT STEM
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to move quickly”: BOLT DART DASH ZIP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to update for accuracy”: AMEND CORRECT FIX REVISE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to breathe heavily”: GASPS HUFFS PANTS PUFFS

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE DEMI PUSH-UP CORE MEAT WIRELESS EARLY SUBSTANCE THRUST LADY BIG SPORTS

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We need to find four words from the list that can be synonymous verbs. 

1. **Identify potential verbs:**
   - SUE: Can be a verb meaning to take legal action.
   - DEMI: Not typically a verb.
   - PUSH-UP: Not typically a verb, but "push" can be.
   - CORE: Can be a verb meaning to remove the core of something.
   - MEAT: Not typically a verb.
   - WIRELESS: Not typically a verb.
   - EARLY: Not typically a verb.
   - SUBSTANCE: Not typically a verb.
   - THRUST: Can be a verb meaning to push or drive with force.
   - LADY: Not typically a verb.
   - BIG: Not typically a verb.
   - SPORTS: Can be a verb meaning to wear or display.

2. **Find potential synonyms:**
   - **SUE**: To take legal action.
   - **THRUST**: To push or drive with force.
   - **PUSH-UP**: "Push" can be a verb meaning to apply force to move something.
   - **CORE**: To remove the core of something.

3. **Check for synonymous relationships:**
   - **PUSH-UP** and **THRUST**: Both can mean to apply force or move something.
   - **CORE**: While it means to remove the core, it doesn't directly align with the others in terms of applying force.
   - **SUE**: Doesn't align with the others in terms of applying force.

4. **Re-evaluate and try another approach:**
   - Let's try another angle. We need four words that can be synonymous verbs.

5. **Reassess potential verbs:**
   - **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both involve applying force.
   - **SPORTS**: To wear or display, doesn't align with the force theme.
   - **CORE**: Still doesn't align with the force theme.

6. **Try another pattern:**
   - If we can't find four words that fit the pattern, we might need to consider a different pattern or re-evaluate the list.

At this point, it seems challenging to find four words that fit the pattern of synonymous verbs. We might need to consider a different pattern or re-evaluate the list for other potential verb meanings. Let me know if you want to try a different approach or pattern.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each homophones

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm potential homophones.

Step 2: Narrow down the list to only include puzzle words that are homophones.

Step 3: From the list of puzzle words that are homophones, try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that each have a common connection. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. 

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each homophones of names of animals: DEAR HAIR HOARSE WAIL
Puzzle words that are each homophones of Greek Letters: MOO NEW PIE ROW

If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over.

Example Input and Output:

Input:

Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: ANGEL, PIRATE, SPELL, WAIL, WITCH, HIVE, COMB,  WAX, DEAR, HAIR, HONEY,  HOARSE, PERIOD, STRETCH, WHILE, CLOWN

Output:

Let’s examine the list of words provided to see which ones are homophones, then narrow down the list to actual homophones, and then see if any are homophones based on a similar connection:

**Step 1: Identify Homophones**

For each word in the list, let’s say the word aloud to find out if it is a homophone

Angel - No homophone comes to mind

Pirate - No homophone comes to mind

Spell - No homophone comes to mind

Wail - Possible homophone “whale” like the sea animal

Witch - Possible homophone “which”

Hive - Possible homophone “I’ve”

Comb - Maybe a homphone of “come”

Wax - No homophone comes to mind

Dear - Possible homophone “deer”

Hair - Possible homophone “hare” or “here” or “hear”

Honey - No homophone comes to mind

Hoarse - Possible homophone “horse”

Period - No homophone comes to mind

Stretch - No homophone comes to mind

While - Possible homophone “wile” or “wild”

Clown - No homophone comes to mind

**Step 2: Narrow down list**

Wail - Possible homophone “whale” like the sea animal

Hive - Possible homophone “I’ve”

Comb - Maybe a homphone of “come”

Dear - Possible homophone “deer”

Hair - Possible homophone “hare” or “here” or “hear”

Hoarse - Possible homophone “horse”

While - Possible homophone “wile” or “wild”

**Step 3: Extract connection from list**

There does appear to be a common set of homophones here. The connection is “animal homophones” and the words are:

WAIL, DEAR, HAIR, HOARSE

— end of example input and output —

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BIG SUBSTANCE EARLY SPORTS LADY SUE DEMI MEAT WIRELESS CORE PUSH-UP THRUST

## Output

Let's go through the steps to identify a possible solution to this puzzle.

**Step 1: Identify Homophones**

For each word in the list, let’s say the word aloud to find out if it is a homophone:

- Big - No homophone comes to mind
- Substance - No homophone comes to mind
- Early - No homophone comes to mind
- Sports - No homophone comes to mind
- Lady - No homophone comes to mind
- Sue - Possible homophone "sue" (legal action) or "sioux" (Native American tribe)
- Demi - No homophone comes to mind
- Meat - Possible homophone "meet"
- Wireless - No homophone comes to mind
- Core - Possible homophone "corps" (military unit)
- Push-up - No homophone comes to mind
- Thrust - No homophone comes to mind

**Step 2: Narrow down list**

From the list, the words that have potential homophones are:

- Sue - Possible homophone "sue" (legal action) or "sioux" (Native American tribe)
- Meat - Possible homophone "meet"
- Core - Possible homophone "corps" (military unit)

**Step 3: Extract connection from list**

We need to find a fourth word that fits a common connection with the identified homophones. Let's consider the connections:

- "Sue" and "Sioux" could relate to legal or tribal themes.
- "Meat" and "Meet" could relate to food or gatherings.
- "Core" and "Corps" could relate to central or military themes.

Unfortunately, we don't have a fourth word that fits any of these themes directly. Let's consider if there might be another pattern or if we need to try a different approach.

If we can't find a fourth word that follows the pattern, we may need to explore other potential homophones or consider a different pattern. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if we should try another approach.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each come after the same prefixes or words

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm prefixes or words that can come before each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular prefixes or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous prefixes or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each come after “tele”: COMMUTE MEDICINE PROMPTER VISION
Puzzle words that each come after “deep”: CUT FAKE FREEZE SIX
Puzzle words that each come after “belly”: BUTTON DANCE FLOP LAUGH

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can have the same prefix or word come before them.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same prefix or word, trying to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each have the same prefix or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: ABSURDITY PROGRESS NONSENSE ADVANCE MARCH SKUNK MADNESS PUSH CUT FREEZE FEET GARBAGE CHEESE FOLLY FAKE SIX

Output:

Let’s examine the list of puzzle words provided to see what prefixes or words come before these puzzle words, then identify puzzle words from the list that have the same prefixes or words that commonly come before them, then identify what other puzzle words could form this connection, then arrive at a conclusion.

**Step 1: Prefixes or words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**ABSURDITY** - sheer, utter, complete

**PROGRESS** - steady, significant, slow

**NONSENSE** - complete, utter, sheer

**ADVANCE** - in, rapid, significant

**MARCH** - long, slow, annual

**SKUNK** - striped, little, dead

**MADNESS** - sheer, utter, pure

**PUSH** - final, gentle, big

**CUT** - deep, budget, price

**FREEZE** - deep, sudden, hard

**FEET** - bare, tired, sore

**GARBAGE** - household, kitchen, street

**CHEESE** - cheddar, blue, cream

**FOLLY** - sheer, utter, complete

**FAKE** - news, ID, tan

**SIX** - number, at, o'clock

**Step 2: Puzzle Words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Sheer - Folly, Absurdity, Madness, Nonsense

Deep - Freeze, Cut

**Step 3: Other puzzle words that could form the connection of “deep”**

**ABSURDITY** - No

**PROGRESS** - No

**NONSENSE** - No

**ADVANCE** - No

**MARCH** - Maybe

**SKUNK** - No

**MADNESS** - No

**PUSH** - No

**FEET** - No

**GARBAGE** - No

**CHEESE** - No

**FOLLY** - No

**FAKE** - Yes!

**SIX** - Yes!

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Two good possibilities:

Puzzle Words that follow sheer: FOLLY ABSURDITY MADNESS NONSENSE

Puzzle Words that follow deep: CUT FAKE FREEZE SIX

— end of example input and output —


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

    - CURE
    - COVE
    - CORK

12. **SPORTS**: 
    - SHORTS
    - SPURTS
    - SORTS

### Step 2: Identify a Connection

Now, let's look for a connection between the brainstormed words:

- **MEAT, BIG, CORE, SPORTS**: These words can be related to food or physical activities.
- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS**: These words are related to physical activities or exercises.
- **LADY, DEMI, SUE**: These words can be related to names or titles.
- **WIRELESS, EARLY, SUBSTANCE**: These words can be related to technology or time.

### Step 3: Find a Group of Four Words

Let's try to find a group of four words that are each one letter away from a word that shares something else in common:

1. **MEAT, BIG, CORE, SPORTS**: 
   - MEAT -> MATE (related to food)
   - BIG -> BAG (related to size or capacity)
   - CORE -> CURE (related to health or wellness)
   - SPORTS -> SORTS (related to categories or types)

2. **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**:
   - THRUST -> TRUST (related to physical activities)
   - PUSH-UP -> PUSHES (related to exercises)
   - SPORTS -> SPURTS (related to physical activities)
   - CORE -> CURE (related to health or wellness)

3. **LADY, DEMI, SUE, EARLY**:
   - LADY -> LACY (related to names or titles)
   - DEMI -> DEVI (related to names)
   - SUE -> SEE (related to names or actions)
   - EARLY -> YEARLY (related to time)

### Conclusion

Based on the brainstormed words and connections, one possible group of four words that match the pattern could be:

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**: These words are each one letter away from words related to physical activities or exercises.

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can try another pattern or explore different connections. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if you'd like to explore further!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: PUSH-UP MEAT EARLY BIG SUBSTANCE DEMI LADY CORE THRUST WIRELESS SUE SPORTS

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, looking for subtle connections between the words. 

1. **PUSH-UP**: This could relate to exercise or something that increases or elevates.

2. **MEAT**: This could relate to food, substance, or the core/essence of something.

3. **EARLY**: This could relate to time, beginnings, or something that precedes.

4. **BIG**: This could relate to size, importance, or something significant.

5. **SUBSTANCE**: This could relate to material, essence, or something with mass.

6. **DEMI**: This could relate to something half or partial (e.g., demi-glace, demigod).

7. **LADY**: This could relate to gender, a title, or a polite form of address.

8. **CORE**: This could relate to the center, essence, or something fundamental.

9. **THRUST**: This could relate to force, movement, or the main point.

10. **WIRELESS**: This could relate to technology, communication, or something without wires.

11. **SUE**: This could relate to legal action or a name.

12. **SPORTS**: This could relate to physical activity, games, or competitions.

Now, let's try to find a group of four words that relate to the same thing:

- **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE** both relate to the essence or central part of something.
- **THRUST** can relate to the main point or essence of an argument or action.
- **MEAT** can also refer to the core or substance of something, as in "the meat of the matter."

These four words—CORE, SUBSTANCE, THRUST, MEAT—could all relate to the concept of "essence" or "central part."

Let's see if this connection holds:

- **CORE**: The central or most important part.
- **SUBSTANCE**: The essential nature or most important part.
- **THRUST**: The main point or essence of an argument or action.
- **MEAT**: The essential part or core of something.

This seems like a plausible connection. If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern. Let me know if you need further assistance!
