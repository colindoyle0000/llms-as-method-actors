Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each relate to the same thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that each relate to the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words relate to the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each relate to “Happy New Year!”: BALL COUNTDOWN FIREWORKS KISS
Puzzle words that each refer to things you can do to your nose: BLOW HOLD PICK THUMB
Puzzle words that each relate to “Oomph”: ENERGY FIRE JUICE ZIP
Puzzle words that are things to blow on for wishes/luck: CANDLE DANDELION DICE EYELASH
Puzzle words that each relate to attraction: APPEAL CHARM DRAW PULL
Puzzle words that each relate to sound/hearing: ACOUSTIC AUDITORY HEARD SONIC
Puzzle words that each refer to things that are cinched in the middle: CORSET DIABOLO HOURGLASS WASP
Puzzle words that each refer to things you can set: MOOD RECORD TABLE VOLLEYBALL
Puzzle words that each relate to Italian demonyms: BOLOGNESE NEAPOLITAN PARMESAN VENETIAN
Puzzle words that each refer to spirals in nature: CYCLONE GALAXY SNAIL SUNFLOWER

Step 2: See if other puzzle words also relate to the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that each relate to the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that each relate to the same thing, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT EARLY CRUNCH PUSH-UP DEMI LADY MARS DOVE PAYDAY SUE WIRELESS SUBSTANCE CORE SPORTS BIG THRUST

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step. We need to find a group of four words that each relate to the same thing. Let's start by examining the words and looking for any potential connections.

1. **MEAT**: Could relate to food, protein, or something substantial.
2. **EARLY**: Could relate to time, beginnings, or something that happens before others.
3. **CRUNCH**: Could relate to sound, texture, or a critical moment.
4. **PUSH-UP**: Could relate to exercise, fitness, or something that involves lifting.
5. **DEMI**: Could relate to something half or partial.
6. **LADY**: Could relate to gender, formality, or a title.
7. **MARS**: Could relate to planets, mythology, or the color red.
8. **DOVE**: Could relate to birds, peace, or a brand.
9. **PAYDAY**: Could relate to salary, work, or a specific day.
10. **SUE**: Could relate to legal action or a name.
11. **WIRELESS**: Could relate to technology, communication, or something without wires.
12. **SUBSTANCE**: Could relate to material, essence, or something tangible.
13. **CORE**: Could relate to center, essential part, or something fundamental.
14. **SPORTS**: Could relate to games, physical activity, or competition.
15. **BIG**: Could relate to size, importance, or something significant.
16. **THRUST**: Could relate to force, movement, or propulsion.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **MEAT, CORE, SUBSTANCE, BIG**: These words could relate to something substantial or essential. "Meat" and "substance" both refer to the core or main part of something. "Core" is literally the central part, and "big" can imply something of great importance or substance.

- **MARS, DOVE, LADY, DEMI**: These words could relate to names or titles. "Mars" and "Dove" are both names (a planet and a bird/brand), "Lady" is a title, and "Demi" is a name (as in Demi Moore) or a prefix meaning half.

- **CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, THRUST**: These words could relate to physical activity or exercise. "Crunch" and "push-up" are exercises, "sports" is a category of physical activities, and "thrust" involves forceful movement, often used in sports contexts.

- **WIRELESS, PAYDAY, EARLY, SUE**: These words could relate to modern life or technology. "Wireless" is a technology term, "payday" is a modern work-related term, "early" can relate to timing in technology releases or work, and "sue" is a legal action, often seen in modern contexts.

Let's focus on the strongest connection:

**CRUNCH, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, THRUST**: These words all relate to physical activity or exercise. "Crunch" and "push-up" are specific exercises, "sports" is a general term for physical activities, and "thrust" is a movement often associated with physical exertion.

This seems like a plausible group of four words that relate to the same thing. Let's go with this combination. If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern.

Puzzle words that are each a type of ice cream treat: FLOAT SHAKE SPLIT SUNDAE
Puzzle words that are each a type of hardware fastener: BOLT NAIL RIVET SCREW
Puzzle words that are each a type of cooking oil: CORN OLIVE PALM PEANUT

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE BIG MEAT DEMI DOVE SPORTS MARS SUE PAYDAY THRUST PUSH-UP EARLY LADY WIRELESS CORE CRUNCH

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying groups of four words that are each a type of the same thing. We'll start by examining the list of puzzle words and see if we can find any connections.

1. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to a material or a type of matter.
2. **BIG**: This is an adjective, so it might not fit well with the others.
3. **MEAT**: This is a type of food.
4. **DEMI**: This could refer to something that is half or partial.
5. **DOVE**: This is a type of bird.
6. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games.
7. **MARS**: This is a planet.
8. **SUE**: This is a legal action.
9. **PAYDAY**: This refers to a day when one receives payment.
10. **THRUST**: This is a type of force or movement.
11. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise.
12. **EARLY**: This is an adjective related to time.
13. **LADY**: This refers to a woman.
14. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology without wires.
15. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something.
16. **CRUNCH**: This could refer to a sound or a type of exercise.

Now, let's try to find a group of four words that are each a type of the same thing:

- **DOVE, MARS, PAYDAY, LADY**: These could all be types of chocolate bars or candy brands. Dove is a chocolate brand, Mars is a chocolate bar, Payday is a candy bar, and Lady could refer to Lady Godiva chocolates.

This seems like a plausible group of four words that match the pattern of being types of the same thing (chocolate or candy brands). Let's go with this solution.

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or group of words. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each come after the same word or phrase

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that can come before each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each come after “SECRET”: AGENT CODE SANTA SAUCE
Puzzle words that each come after “FUNNY”: BONE BUSINESS GIRL PAGES
Puzzle words that each come after “SILVER”: FOX LINING SCREEN SPOON
Puzzle words that each come after “STICKY”: FINGERS NOTE RICE WICKET

Puzzle words that each come after “SPACE”: BAR CADET HEATER STATION
Puzzle words that each come after “LIVING”: LARGE LEGEND PROOF ROOM
Puzzle words that each come after “HEAD OF”: HAIR LETTUCE STATE STEAM

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can have the same word come before them.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same word come before them, trying to arrive at a group of four words that can each have the same word come before them. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BABY SEGMENT DEAR SANTA LINE FIRE POINT BOO RAY JUICE ENERGY AGENT ZIP LOVE CODE SAUCE

Output:

Let’s examine the list of puzzle words provided to see what words come before these words, then identify puzzle words from the list that have the same words that commonly come before them, then identify what other puzzle words could form this connection, then arrive at a conclusion.

**Step 1: Words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each share the same unique characteristic. For this pattern, the connection is with how the puzzle words are structured or how the words sound, not with what the words mean.

Steps to take:

Step 1: Say different puzzle words aloud and try to identify two puzzle words that share a unique characteristic related to how the word is structured or sounds. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular characteristics are more likely to be the correct connection than generic and ubiquitous characteristics. Think outside the box.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each heteronyms: BASS DOVE DESERT WIND
Puzzle words that are each letter spellings: BEE EX GEE JAY
Puzzle words that are each two letters + number: CANINE FREIGHT OFTEN STONE
Puzzle words that are each examples of onomatopoeia: BANG PLOP SPLASH THUD
Puzzle words that are each ”-ough” words that don’t rhyme: BOUGH COUGH DOUGH TOUGH
Puzzle words that are each words you say twice in a row: BOO POM TOM YO
Puzzle words that are each palindromes: BIB EYE GAG POP

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can have that same characteristic. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CORE MEAT WIRELESS MARS LADY CRUNCH PAYDAY SPORTS DOVE SUE PUSH-UP EARLY DEMI THRUST BIG SUBSTANCE

## Output

Let's go through the list of puzzle words and see if we can identify a unique characteristic that connects four of them. We'll start by saying each word aloud and considering their structure or sound.

1. **CORE**
2. **MEAT**
3. **WIRELESS**
4. **MARS**
5. **LADY**
6. **CRUNCH**
7. **PAYDAY**
8. **SPORTS**
9. **DOVE**
10. **SUE**
11. **PUSH-UP**
12. **EARLY**
13. **DEMI**
14. **THRUST**
15. **BIG**
16. **SUBSTANCE**

Let's consider some potential characteristics:

- **Homophones**: Words that sound like other words but have different meanings. For example, "DOVE" (the bird) and "DOVE" (past tense of dive) are homophones. However, we need four words, so let's see if there are others.
  
- **Compound Words**: Words made up of two smaller words. "PAYDAY" and "PUSH-UP" are compound words. Let's see if there are two more.
  
- **Words with Silent Letters**: Words that contain letters that are not pronounced. "DOVE" (if pronounced as the bird) has a silent 'e'. Let's see if there are others.

- **Words with Double Letters**: Words that contain a pair of the same letter. None of the words in the list seem to fit this pattern.

- **Words with a Specific Syllable Count**: Words that have a specific number of syllables. For example, "WIRELESS" and "SUBSTANCE" both have three syllables.

Let's focus on the compound words pattern:

- **PAYDAY**: Compound word (pay + day)
- **PUSH-UP**: Compound word (push + up)
- **WIRELESS**: Compound word (wire + less)
- **SPORTS**: Not a compound word, but let's see if there's another compound word.

Upon further inspection, "SPORTS" doesn't fit, but "EARLY" and "THRUST" don't fit either. Let's try another pattern.

Let's try the homophones pattern:

- **DOVE**: Homophone (dove - bird, dove - past tense of dive)
- **SUE**: Homophone (sue - to take legal action, su - a type of fish)
- **MEAT**: Homophone (meat - food, meet - to encounter)
- **THRUST**: Not a homophone, but let's see if there's another homophone.

Upon further inspection, "THRUST" doesn't fit, but "CORE" (core - center, corps - military unit) could fit.

Let's finalize the homophones pattern:

- **DOVE**: Homophone
- **SUE**: Homophone
- **MEAT**: Homophone
- **CORE**: Homophone

This group of four words shares the characteristic of being homophones. Let's go with this solution. If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are all within the same category

Steps to take:

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category of things. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle categories are more likely to be the correct connection than simple and ubiquitous categories. Describe the category as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are all within the category of “places in France”: CHAMPAGNE DIJON NICE TOURS
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “black-and-white animals”: ORCA PANDA SKUNK ZEBRA
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “art mediums”: CHARCOAL INK PAINT PASTEL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “basic geometric objects”: LINE POINT RAY SEGMENT
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “avenues in New York City”: BROADWAY FIFTH MADISON PARK
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “cool ’80s slang”: BAD FLY FRESH RAD
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “Disney characters”: DAISY GOOFY HAPPY LADY
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “airline classes”: BUSINESS COACH FIRST PREMIUM
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “notable tv episodes”: FINALE PILOT PREMIERE SPECIAL
Puzzle words that are all within the category of “classic halloween costumes”: ANGEL CLOWN PIRATE WITCH
Puzzle words that are all within the category of state abbreviations: HI LA MA OK

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can belong to that same category, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: PAYDAY EARLY SUE DEMI CORE MEAT SPORTS LADY THRUST WIRELESS DOVE SUBSTANCE CRUNCH MARS PUSH-UP BIG

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, as you suggested.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are within the same category.**

1. **PAYDAY and MARS**: Both are names of candy bars.
2. **LADY and DEMI**: Both can be names of famous people (Lady Gaga, Demi Moore).
3. **WIRELESS and CORE**: Both can be related to technology (wireless technology, core processors).
4. **SPORTS and MEAT**: Both can be categories of magazines (Sports Illustrated, Meat & Poultry).

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can belong to that same category.**

Let's explore the first option: **PAYDAY and MARS** as candy bars.

- **CRUNCH**: Another candy bar (Nestlé Crunch).
- **DEM**: Could be a stretch, but "DEM" could be short for "Demi," which is not a candy bar. Let's try another word.
- **DOVE**: Another candy brand (Dove chocolate).

So, we have: **PAYDAY, MARS, CRUNCH, DOVE** - all are candy bars.

This seems to fit the pattern of being within the same category. Let's go with this solution.

If this doesn't work, we can explore other categories or combinations. Let me know if you need further assistance!
