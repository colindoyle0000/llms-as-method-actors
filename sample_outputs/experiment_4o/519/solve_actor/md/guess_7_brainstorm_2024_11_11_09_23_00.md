Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that share a pop culture reference

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle pop culture references are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious pop culture references. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words share a pop culture reference.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the name of jazz legends: HANCOCK HOLIDAY MONK PARKER
Puzzle words that are each last names of superheroes: BANNER PRINCE STARK WAYNE
Puzzle words that are each TV shows with happy-sounding names: CHEERS EUPHORIA FELICITY GLEE
Puzzle words that are each things in “my favorite things”: KETTLES MITTENS RAINDROPS WHISKERS
Puzzle words that are each the name of an NBA team player: CLIPPER PACER ROCKET SPUR
Puzzle words that are each the name of a famous guitarist: BERRY KING PAGE WATERS
Puzzle words that are each the name of a famous poem: DADDY HARLEM HOWL IF
Puzzle words that are each the last name of a pop megastar: GRANDE MARS STYLES SWIFT
Puzzle words that are each rooms in the game clue: HALL LIBRARY LOUNGE STUDY
Puzzle words that are each lands at Disneyland: ADVENTURE FANTASY FRONTIER TOMORROW

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by sharing the same pop culture reference. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE CORE THRUST SUBSTANCE WIRELESS BIG LADY PUSH-UP DEMI MEAT SPORTS EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, looking for potential pop culture references that could connect four of these words.

1. **SUE and DEMI**: Both could be first names of famous people. Sue could refer to Sue Storm from the Fantastic Four, and Demi could refer to Demi Moore, the actress. However, this connection doesn't seem strong enough to find two more words.

2. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: These words could relate to something scientific or technological, but it's hard to find a pop culture reference that ties them together with other words.

3. **WIRELESS and SPORTS**: These could relate to modern technology and broadcasting, but again, it's difficult to find a pop culture reference that ties them together with other words.

4. **BIG and LADY**: These could refer to famous songs or artists. "Big" could refer to The Notorious B.I.G., and "Lady" could refer to Lady Gaga. Let's see if we can find two more words that fit this theme.

5. **PUSH-UP and EARLY**: These could relate to fitness or routines, but it's hard to find a pop culture reference that ties them together with other words.

6. **THRUST and MEAT**: These could relate to cooking or grilling, but again, it's difficult to find a pop culture reference that ties them together with other words.

7. **DEMI and LADY**: Both could refer to famous female artists. Demi could refer to Demi Lovato, and Lady could refer to Lady Gaga. Let's see if we can find two more words that fit this theme.

8. **BIG, LADY, DEMI, and EARLY**: This could be a potential group. "Big" for The Notorious B.I.G., "Lady" for Lady Gaga, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, and "Early" could refer to something like Early Morning shows or songs. However, "Early" feels like a stretch here.

Let's try to refine this further:

- **BIG, LADY, DEMI, and SUE**: This could be a group of first names of famous people. "Big" for The Notorious B.I.G., "Lady" for Lady Gaga, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, and "Sue" for Sue Storm. However, "Sue" feels a bit out of place.

- **BIG, LADY, DEMI, and CORE**: This could be a group of words related to music. "Big" for The Notorious B.I.G., "Lady" for Lady Gaga, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, and "Core" could refer to a music genre like Hardcore. However, "Core" feels a bit out of place.

It seems like we're struggling to find a strong connection with four words. Let's try another approach:

- **BIG, LADY, DEMI, and SPORTS**: This could be a group of words related to entertainment. "Big" for The Notorious B.I.G., "Lady" for Lady Gaga, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, and "Sports" for ESPN or sports entertainment. However, "Sports" feels a bit out of place.

It seems like we're having difficulty finding a strong connection with four words. Let's try another pattern or set of words. If you have any other ideas or want to explore a different angle, let me know!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can mean the same thing. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can mean the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can mean the same thing.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “how fast something is going”: CLIP PACE RATE SPEED
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to fail to attend”: CUT DITCH MISS SKIP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to become aware of”: DISCOVER FIND LEARN REALIZE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to apply pressure to”: CRUSH MASH PRESS SQUASH
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to chat informally”: GAB JAW YAK YAP
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “pretense”: AFFECT AIRS CHARADE FRONT
Puzzle words that can each be a noun meaning “foolishness”: ABSURDITY FOLLY MADNESS NONSENSE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to move forward”: ADVANCE MARCH PROGRESS PUSH
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to get smaller”: CONTRACT LESSEN REDUCE SHRINK
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to criticize”: BLAST KNOCK SLAM TRASH

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also mean the same thing as the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can mean the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can mean the same thing, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BIG DEMI EARLY CORE THRUST MEAT SUBSTANCE WIRELESS SPORTS LADY SUE PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying words that can mean the same thing and function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can mean the same thing.

1. **CORE** and **SUBSTANCE**: Both can be nouns meaning the essential part or essence of something.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also mean the same thing.

- **MEAT**: This can also be a noun meaning the essential part or substance of something, often used metaphorically (e.g., "the meat of the argument").
- **THRUST**: As a noun, it can mean the main point or essence of something, similar to "core" or "substance."

So, we have a potential group of four words:

- CORE
- SUBSTANCE
- MEAT
- THRUST

Each of these words can function as a noun meaning the essential part or essence of something.

Let's verify if this group fits the pattern:

- CORE: The central or most important part.
- SUBSTANCE: The essential nature or most important part of something.
- MEAT: The essential or most important part of something.
- THRUST: The main point or essence of an argument or discussion.

This group seems to fit the pattern well. If you think this is a viable solution, we can proceed with it. If not, we can explore other combinations. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can each be a part of a different word within the same category. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular categories are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous categories. As precisely as possible, describe how each of the two puzzle words can be part of a different word within the same category.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the first letters of a zodiac sign: CAN GEM LIB TAU
Puzzle words that are each the first letters of the name of a planet: EAR MAR MER SAT
Puzzle words that each start with letters that form the name of a rock band: CREAMSICLE JOURNEYMAN KISSCAM RUSHMORE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can be part of different words within that same category. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be parts of different words within the same category.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI CORE SPORTS SUE EARLY BIG WIRELESS LADY SUBSTANCE THRUST MEAT PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, focusing on identifying a category that can link four of these words together. 

### Step 1: Identify Two Puzzle Words

1. **DEMI**: This could be part of the word "demigod" or "demiglace." 
2. **CORE**: This could be part of the word "coreopsis" (a type of flower) or "coreboard."

Let's see if we can find a category that links these two words. 

### Step 2: Explore Categories

- **DEMI** and **CORE** could both relate to the category of **fitness**:
  - **DEMI**: "Demi-squat" (a type of squat exercise)
  - **CORE**: "Core workout" (a type of exercise focusing on the core muscles)

Let's see if other words can fit into this category:

3. **PUSH-UP**: Clearly fits into the fitness category as a type of exercise.
4. **THRUST**: Could relate to "thrust exercise" or "hip thrust," which is a common exercise.

### Step 3: Verify the Category

The category of **fitness exercises** seems to fit well:

- **DEMI**: Demi-squat
- **CORE**: Core workout
- **PUSH-UP**: Push-up exercise
- **THRUST**: Hip thrust exercise

This group of words fits the pattern of being parts of different words within the same category of fitness exercises. 

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can explore other categories or combinations. Let me know if you want to try another approach or if this solution works!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each modify the same word

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that each puzzle word can modify. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular words rather than generic and ubiquitous words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each modify “pepper”: BELL BLACK DR GHOST
Puzzle words that each modify “trap”: BEAR SAND SPEED TOURIST
Puzzle words that each modify “hour”: AMATEUR ELEVENTH HAPPY RUSH
Puzzle words that each modify “dream”: AMERICAN FEVER LUCID PIPE
Puzzle words that each modify “bat”: BASEBALL CRICKET FRUIT VAMPIRE

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can each modify the same word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so a unique and particular word being modified is more likely to be correct than a generic and ubiquitous word.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can modify that same word. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each modify the same word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that each modify the same word, start over at Step 2.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: PUSH-UP DEMI MEAT THRUST WIRELESS CORE SPORTS LADY SUE SUBSTANCE BIG EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by examining each word and brainstorming possible words they could modify. We need to find a common word that can be modified by four of the puzzle words.

1. **PUSH-UP**: 
   - Could modify "bra" (push-up bra)
   - Could modify "exercise" (push-up exercise)

2. **DEMI**:
   - Could modify "moore" (Demi Moore)
   - Could modify "glace" (demi-glace)
   - Could modify "god" (demi-god)

3. **MEAT**:
   - Could modify "market" (meat market)
   - Could modify "pie" (meat pie)
   - Could modify "loaf" (meat loaf)

4. **THRUST**:
   - Could modify "stage" (thrust stage)
   - Could modify "vector" (thrust vector)

5. **WIRELESS**:
   - Could modify "network" (wireless network)
   - Could modify "router" (wireless router)

6. **CORE**:
   - Could modify "strength" (core strength)
   - Could modify "values" (core values)

7. **SPORTS**:
   - Could modify "car" (sports car)
   - Could modify "team" (sports team)

8. **LADY**:
   - Could modify "gaga" (Lady Gaga)
   - Could modify "bug" (ladybug)

9. **SUE**:
   - Could modify "storm" (Sue Storm)
   - Could modify "grafton" (Sue Grafton)

10. **SUBSTANCE**:
    - Could modify "abuse" (substance abuse)
    - Could modify "painter" (substance painter)

11. **BIG**:
    - Could modify "bang" (big bang)
    - Could modify "deal" (big deal)

12. **EARLY**:
    - Could modify "bird" (early bird)
    - Could modify "morning" (early morning)

Now, let's try to find a common word that can be modified by four of these puzzle words:

- **CORE**: 
  - Could be modified by "PUSH-UP" (push-up core), "WIRELESS" (wireless core), "SPORTS" (sports core), and "DEMI" (demi-core).

- **STAGE**:
  - Could be modified by "THRUST" (thrust stage), "LADY" (lady stage), "BIG" (big stage), and "EARLY" (early stage).

- **MARKET**:
  - Could be modified by "MEAT" (meat market), "WIRELESS" (wireless market), "SPORTS" (sports market), and "LADY" (lady market).

- **CAR**:
  - Could be modified by "SPORTS" (sports car), "BIG" (big car), "WIRELESS" (wireless car), and "LADY" (lady car).

From these options, the most promising seems to be "CORE" with the words "PUSH-UP," "WIRELESS," "SPORTS," and "DEMI." However, "demi-core" is not a common term, so this might not be the correct solution.

Let's try another approach:

- **NETWORK**:
  - Could be modified by "WIRELESS" (wireless network), "CORE" (core network), "SPORTS" (sports network), and "SUBSTANCE" (substance network).

This seems more plausible. Let's go with "NETWORK" as the word being modified by "WIRELESS," "CORE," "SPORTS," and "SUBSTANCE."

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or combination. Let me know if you need further assistance!

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: THRUST EARLY SPORTS CORE SUBSTANCE BIG WIRELESS LADY PUSH-UP SUE DEMI MEAT

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, looking for subtle connections between the words. We need to find a group of four words that are each a kind of the same thing.

1. **THRUST and PUSH-UP**: Both of these words can be related to exercises or movements. However, they don't immediately suggest a broader category that includes four words.

2. **EARLY and DEMI**: These words don't seem to have a direct connection.

3. **SPORTS and WIRELESS**: These words don't seem to have a direct connection.

4. **CORE and SUBSTANCE**: Both of these words can relate to the central or essential part of something. However, they don't immediately suggest a broader category that includes four words.

5. **BIG and LADY**: These words don't seem to have a direct connection.

6. **SUE and DEMI**: These words don't seem to have a direct connection.

7. **MEAT**: This word stands alone without an immediate connection to others.

Let's try to find a more subtle connection:

- **CORE, SUBSTANCE, MEAT, and WIRELESS**: This is a bit of a stretch, but if we think of "core" as the central part, "substance" as the essential material, "meat" as the main part of a meal, and "wireless" as a type of technology, they all relate to the idea of being central or essential in their respective contexts. However, "wireless" doesn't fit as neatly.

- **THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, and CORE**: These words can all relate to physical activity or fitness. "Thrust" and "push-up" are movements, "sports" is a category of physical activities, and "core" is often used in fitness to refer to exercises targeting the central muscles of the body.

This last group seems to be the most promising connection. Let's go with:

**THRUST, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, CORE**: Each of these words can be related to physical activity or fitness.

If this doesn't work, we can try another pattern or set of words. Let me know if you need further assistance!
