Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous adjectives.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “wee”: DINKY LITTLE MINUTE SLIGHT
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “primary”: CHIEF FIRST MAIN PRINCIPAL
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “gentle”: LIGHT MELLOW MILD SOFT
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “absolute”: PURE SHEER TOTAL UTTER
Puzzle words that can each be an adjective meaning “indecent”: BAWDY BLUE COARSE RISQUE

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SPORTS EARLY PUSH-UP SUE BIG DEMI WIRELESS LADY

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step by identifying potential synonymous adjectives among the given words: SPORTS, EARLY, PUSH-UP, SUE, BIG, DEMI, WIRELESS, LADY.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous adjectives.

1. **BIG**: This can be an adjective meaning large or significant.
2. **DEMI**: This is a bit tricky, but "demi" can imply something partial or half-sized, which might not directly fit with "big." Let's hold onto this for now and explore other options.

Let's try another pair:

1. **EARLY**: This can be an adjective meaning happening or done before the usual or expected time.
2. **LADY**: This doesn't seem to fit as an adjective synonymous with "early."

Let's try another pair:

1. **WIRELESS**: This can be an adjective meaning without wires, often used to describe technology.
2. **SPORTS**: This doesn't seem to fit as an adjective synonymous with "wireless."

Let's try another pair:

1. **BIG**: As mentioned, this can mean large or significant.
2. **LADY**: This doesn't fit as an adjective synonymous with "big."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.

Let's try another approach:

1. **BIG**: Large or significant.
2. **DEMI**: As mentioned, this might not fit well with "big."

Let's try another pair:

1. **EARLY**: Happening or done before the usual or expected time.
2. **PUSH-UP**: This doesn't fit as an adjective synonymous with "early."

Let's try another pair:

1. **WIRELESS**: Without wires.
2. **DEMI**: This doesn't fit as an adjective synonymous with "wireless."

It seems challenging to find a group of four words that fit the pattern of being synonymous adjectives. Let's try another pattern or approach if this doesn't yield results.

If you have any other ideas or patterns to explore, please let me know!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous. With this patten, each of the words must function as the same part of speech.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to follow”: SHADOW TAIL TRACK TRAIL

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BIG SPORTS SUE PUSH-UP DEMI LADY EARLY WIRELESS

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential synonyms among the given puzzle words. 

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonyms.

1. **BIG**: This is an adjective meaning "large in size or extent."
2. **SPORTS**: This is a noun, typically referring to physical activities or games.
3. **SUE**: This is a verb meaning "to take legal action against someone."
4. **PUSH-UP**: This is a noun, referring to a type of exercise.
5. **DEMI**: This is an adjective meaning "half" or "partial."
6. **LADY**: This is a noun meaning "a woman."
7. **EARLY**: This is an adjective or adverb meaning "before the usual or expected time."
8. **WIRELESS**: This is an adjective or noun referring to technology that operates without wires.

Let's start by looking for synonyms:

- **BIG**: Could potentially be synonymous with words like "large," "huge," or "great."
- **EARLY**: Could potentially be synonymous with words like "premature," "initial," or "first."

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.

- **BIG**: None of the other words seem to fit as synonyms for "big."
- **EARLY**: None of the other words seem to fit as synonyms for "early."

It seems like we might not have a group of four words that can be synonymous with each other based on the initial analysis. Let's try another approach:

- **SPORTS**: Could potentially be synonymous with "games" or "athletics."
- **LADY**: Could potentially be synonymous with "woman" or "female."

Again, none of the other words seem to fit as synonyms for "sports" or "lady."

Given the current list of words, it seems challenging to find a group of four words that can be synonymous with each other. We might need to consider a different pattern or approach. If you have any other ideas or if there's another pattern you'd like to explore, let me know!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same set of letters

Steps to take: 

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm letters or words that can follow each word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular sets of letters or words rather than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “berry”: BLUE GOOSE RASP STRAW
Puzzle words that are each followed by “land countries”: ICE IRE FIN NETHER
Puzzle words that are each followed by “-o”: DADDY DAY JACKIE JELL

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same set of letters or words that can follow them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular sets of letters or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words. 

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have that same set of letters or word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same set of letters or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: BOAT BLUE CAR PLANE STRAW TRANSPORTATION PINCH DASH GAME GOOSE RASP IN ON BOARD DROP SPLASH DOWN

Output:

Let’s examine the list of words provided to see what set of letters commonly follow these words, then identify words that have the same letters that commonly follow them:

**Step 1: Identify letters that follow these puzzle words**

**BOAT** - house, yard, load, race

**BLUE** - berry, print, jay, tooth

**CAR** - pet, pool, port, bon

**PLANE** - tarium, trees, tary, table

**STRAW** - berry, man, bale, hat

**TRANSPORTATION** - al, infrastructure, system, sector

**PINCH** - ed, ing, point, hit

**DASH** - board, ing, ed, line

**GAME** - play, board, plan, master

**GOOSE** - berry, bump, neck, flesh

**RASP** - berry, ing, ed, er

**IN** - side, to, put, come

**ON** - line, ward, going, to

**BOARD** - room, walk, game, ing

**DROP** - let, down, out, box

**SPLASH** - ing, ed, down, page

**DOWN** - load, town, ward, pour

**Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same letters that commonly follow them**

1. **BLUE** - berry
2. **GOOSE** - berry
3. **RASP** - berry
4. **STRAW** - berry

These puzzle words are all commonly followed by "berry.”

**Step: 3 See if other puzzle words on the list can have the same letters follow them**

Already found four words followed by “berry”

1. **BLUE** - berry
2. **GOOSE** - berry
3. **RASP** - berry
4. **STRAW** - berry

— end of example input and output —

Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are different aspects of the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. Describe the connection between the puzzle words as precisely as possible.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Words that are each different aspects of the sharpness as of an image: CLARITY DEFINITION DETAIL RESOLUTION
Words that are each different aspects of plant growths: BLOOM BUD SHOOT SPROUT
Words that are each different aspects of bee creations: COMB HIVE HONEY WAX
Words that are each different aspects of movie summary info: CAST GENRE PLOT TITLE
Words that are each different aspects of sheet music: CLEF NOTE REST STAFF
Words that are each different aspects of solar emanations: CORONA FLARE LIGHT RADIATION

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be different aspects of the same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each different aspects of the same thing, start over at Step 1.



If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: DEMI SPORTS SUE LADY WIRELESS PUSH-UP BIG EARLY

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying connections between the words that could represent different aspects of the same thing.

1. **DEMI**: This could refer to something that is half or partial, like a "demigod" or "demitasse."

2. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games, often competitive, like football, basketball, etc.

3. **SUE**: This is a legal term, meaning to bring a lawsuit against someone.

4. **LADY**: This refers to a woman or a polite term for a female.

5. **WIRELESS**: This refers to technology that operates without physical connections, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

6. **PUSH-UP**: This is a type of exercise involving pushing one's body up from the ground.

7. **BIG**: This describes something of large size or importance.

8. **EARLY**: This refers to something happening before the usual or expected time.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **DEMI** and **LADY**: Both could relate to aspects of a person or character. "Demi" could refer to a partial or lesser-known aspect, while "Lady" is a term for a woman.

- **SPORTS** and **PUSH-UP**: Both relate to physical activity or fitness.

- **WIRELESS** and **EARLY**: These could relate to technology, with "wireless" being a modern advancement and "early" possibly referring to early technology or innovations.

- **BIG** and **EARLY**: These could relate to time or development stages, with "big" indicating significance and "early" indicating timing.

Let's try to find a group of four words:

1. **SPORTS**: Physical activity.
2. **PUSH-UP**: A specific exercise.
3. **WIRELESS**: A modern technology.
4. **EARLY**: Could relate to early technology or innovations.

This group could represent different aspects of physical and technological development:

- **SPORTS** and **PUSH-UP**: Different aspects of physical fitness.
- **WIRELESS** and **EARLY**: Different aspects of technological advancement.

This is one possible interpretation. If this doesn't seem to fit, we can try another approach or pattern. Let me know if you have any other ideas or if we should explore a different angle!

Pattern: Puzzle words that share a pop culture reference

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle pop culture references are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious pop culture references. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words share a pop culture reference.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each the name of jazz legends: HANCOCK HOLIDAY MONK PARKER
Puzzle words that are each last names of superheroes: BANNER PRINCE STARK WAYNE
Puzzle words that are each TV shows with happy-sounding names: CHEERS EUPHORIA FELICITY GLEE
Puzzle words that are each things in “my favorite things”: KETTLES MITTENS RAINDROPS WHISKERS
Puzzle words that are each the name of an NBA team player: CLIPPER PACER ROCKET SPUR
Puzzle words that are each the name of a famous guitarist: BERRY KING PAGE WATERS
Puzzle words that are each the name of a famous poem: DADDY HARLEM HOWL IF
Puzzle words that are each the last name of a pop megastar: GRANDE MARS STYLES SWIFT
Puzzle words that are each rooms in the game clue: HALL LIBRARY LOUNGE STUDY
Puzzle words that are each lands at Disneyland: ADVENTURE FANTASY FRONTIER TOMORROW

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by sharing the same pop culture reference. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that share a pop culture reference, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: WIRELESS SUE PUSH-UP LADY EARLY BIG DEMI SPORTS

## Output

Let's tackle this step by step, focusing on identifying potential pop culture references that could connect four of these words.

1. **WIRELESS**: This could refer to technology, but in pop culture, it might relate to something like "Wireless" by Childish Gambino, or perhaps a concept in a movie or TV show.

2. **SUE**: This could refer to Sue Storm from the Fantastic Four, or Sue Sylvester from "Glee." It could also be a reference to the song "A Boy Named Sue" by Johnny Cash.

3. **PUSH-UP**: This might be a bit tricky, but it could relate to fitness culture or a specific scene in a movie or TV show where push-ups are significant.

4. **LADY**: This could refer to Lady Gaga, Lady and the Tramp, or even the song "Lady" by Styx.

5. **EARLY**: This might refer to something like "Early Edition," a TV show, or perhaps a character known for being early or having "early" in their name.

6. **BIG**: This could refer to the movie "Big" starring Tom Hanks, or Biggie Smalls (The Notorious B.I.G.).

7. **DEMI**: This could refer to Demi Moore, Demi Lovato, or even the concept of "demi" in mythology or literature.

8. **SPORTS**: This could refer to the movie "Sports Night," or it could be a broader reference to sports culture or a specific sports-related pop culture reference.

Now, let's try to find a connection:

- **LADY** and **DEMI**: Both could refer to pop stars (Lady Gaga and Demi Lovato).
- **BIG**: Could fit with pop stars if we consider Biggie Smalls.
- **SUE**: If we consider Sue Sylvester from "Glee," it doesn't quite fit with the pop star theme.

Let's try another angle:

- **BIG**, **DEMI**, **LADY**, and **SUE**: If we consider "Big" as in Biggie Smalls, "Demi" as Demi Lovato, "Lady" as Lady Gaga, and "Sue" as Sue Sylvester from "Glee," we might have a connection through music and TV pop culture.

This is a bit of a stretch, but it could be a potential solution. If this doesn't work, we might need to consider another pattern or connection. Let me know if you want to explore another angle or if you have more words to consider!
