## Prompts

system: ""”

Your task is to look over these notes about whether to submit a guess now or do more brainstorming before submitting a guess.

If the notes indicate that we should submit a guess, your response should be the word “Yes” and no other text.

If the notes indicate that we should not submit a guess and need to brainstorm more, your response should be the word “No” and no other text.

Notes:

Based on the notes and analysis provided, the strongest connection appears to be with the words **MARS, PAYDAY, DOVE, CRUNCH**. These words can all be followed by "bar," which is a common term for types of candy bars. This connection is specific, clear, and fits the pattern of unique connections often found in New York Times puzzles.

Given the urgency and the need for precision in this situation, I recommend submitting **MARS, PAYDAY, DOVE, CRUNCH** as a guess. This connection is strong and aligns well with the criteria for a valid guess in the puzzle.

Submit this guess now, and let's hope it helps in defusing the situation.

"""

user: Yes = submit a guess. No = go back to brainstorming.
