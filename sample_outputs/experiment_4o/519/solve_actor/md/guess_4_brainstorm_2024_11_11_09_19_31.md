Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you can find connections between words that no one can. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

Our guys have been trying all day to crack this puzzle without much luck. The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there may be a group of four puzzle words that matches the following pattern. 

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are parts of the same thing or process

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the puzzle words are parts of the same thing or process.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each parts of a car: BUMPER HOOD TIRE TRUNK
Puzzle words that are each cuts of pork: BELLY CHOP HOCK SHOULDER
Puzzle words that are each seen in a laundry room: DRYER HAMPER IRON WASHER
Puzzle words that are each sections of a book: APPENDIX CHAPTER INDEX PREFACE
Puzzle words that are each things used to build a snowman: CARROT COAL SNOW STICKS
Puzzle words that are each parts of a golf course: BUNKER FAIRWAY GREEN ROUGH
Puzzle words that are each pinball machine components: BALL BUMPER FLIPPER PLUNGER
Puzzle words that are each parts of a shoe: EYELET LACE SOLE TONGUE
Puzzle words that are each parts of a river: BANK BED DELTA MOUTH
Puzzle words that are each in the nato alphabet: ALFA BRAVO ROMEO TANGO

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by being part of the same thing or process. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process, start over at Step 1.


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

 

Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUBSTANCE WIRELESS PUSH-UP BIG CRUNCH EARLY SUE LADY CORE THRUST MARS MEAT DEMI DOVE SPORTS PAYDAY

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, looking for connections between the words that could indicate they are parts of the same thing or process.

1. **SUBSTANCE**: This could refer to a material or an essential part of something.
2. **WIRELESS**: This typically refers to technology that operates without physical connections, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
3. **PUSH-UP**: This is an exercise, but it could also refer to something that elevates or supports.
4. **BIG CRUNCH**: This is a theoretical cosmological event, the opposite of the Big Bang.
5. **EARLY**: This could refer to time, something that happens sooner rather than later.
6. **SUE**: This is a legal action.
7. **LADY**: This refers to a woman, but could also be part of a title or name.
8. **CORE**: This could refer to the central part of something, like the Earth or an apple.
9. **THRUST**: This is a forceful push or drive, often used in physics or engineering.
10. **MARS**: This is a planet, but could also refer to the Roman god of war.
11. **MEAT**: This is food, specifically animal flesh.
12. **DEMI**: This means half or partial, often used in names or titles.
13. **DOVE**: This is a bird, but could also symbolize peace.
14. **SPORTS**: This refers to physical activities or games.
15. **PAYDAY**: This is the day on which someone receives their salary.

Now, let's try to find connections:

- **CORE, THRUST, BIG CRUNCH, MARS**: These could all relate to space or physics. "CORE" could refer to the core of a planet, "THRUST" to the force used in space travel, "BIG CRUNCH" to a cosmological event, and "MARS" to a planet. This could be a potential group related to space or astrophysics.

- **SUBSTANCE, CORE, MEAT, DEMI**: These could relate to food or cooking. "SUBSTANCE" as the material or ingredient, "CORE" as the central part of a fruit, "MEAT" as a type of food, and "DEMI" as in demi-glace, a culinary term.

- **WIRELESS, PUSH-UP, THRUST, SPORTS**: These could relate to physical activities or technology. "WIRELESS" for technology, "PUSH-UP" as an exercise, "THRUST" as a physical force, and "SPORTS" as physical activities.

- **LADY, DOVE, DEMI, EARLY**: These could relate to names or titles. "LADY" as a title, "DOVE" as a symbol or name, "DEMI" as a prefix or name, and "EARLY" as a descriptor.

Let's focus on the first group related to space or physics:

- **CORE**: Central part of a planet.
- **THRUST**: Force used in space travel.
- **BIG CRUNCH**: Cosmological event.
- **MARS**: A planet.

This seems like a plausible group of four words that are parts of the same thing or process related to space or astrophysics. Let's go with this combination. If this doesn't work, we can explore other connections.

Pattern: Puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. As precisely as possible, describe how the two puzzle words can be synonymous verbs.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to restrain”: CHECK CURB LIMIT STEM
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to move quickly”: BOLT DART DASH ZIP
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to update for accuracy”: AMEND CORRECT FIX REVISE
Puzzle words that can each be a verb meaning “to breathe heavily”: GASPS HUFFS PANTS PUFFS

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular synonyms are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous synonyms. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs, start over at Step 1.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: CRUNCH CORE DEMI PAYDAY LADY SUE EARLY MEAT THRUST BIG MARS SUBSTANCE WIRELESS SPORTS DOVE PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's tackle this puzzle step by step, following the pattern of finding synonymous verbs.

**Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that can be synonymous verbs.**

1. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both can be verbs related to exerting force or moving something forward. "Thrust" means to push something suddenly or violently in a specified direction, and "push-up" can be interpreted as pushing oneself up, especially in the context of exercise.

2. **SUE** and **DEMI**: "Sue" is a verb meaning to initiate legal proceedings against someone. "Demi" doesn't directly fit as a verb, so let's reconsider this pair.

3. **CRUNCH** and **CORE**: "Crunch" can be a verb meaning to crush something noisily between teeth or to process numbers. "Core" can be a verb meaning to remove the central part of something, like an apple. These don't seem to be synonymous.

4. **DOVE** and **THRUST**: "Dove" is the past tense of "dive," which means to plunge headfirst into water or to move quickly. "Thrust" can mean to push or drive with force. These could be synonymous in the context of moving quickly or forcefully.

**Step 2: See if other puzzle words can also be synonymous with the puzzle words you’ve identified.**

Let's focus on the potential synonymous verbs related to movement or force:

- **THRUST**: To push or drive with force.
- **DOVE**: Past tense of "dive," meaning to plunge or move quickly.
- **PUSH-UP**: To push oneself up, especially in exercise.
- **SHOVE**: To push roughly or with force.

Unfortunately, "SHOVE" is not in the list, so let's try another approach.

**Re-evaluate potential pairs:**

1. **THRUST** and **DOVE**: Both involve forceful movement.
2. **THRUST** and **PUSH-UP**: Both involve pushing or exerting force.

Let's see if we can find a fourth word:

- **THRUST**
- **DOVE**
- **PUSH-UP**
- **SPORTS**: In a broad sense, "sports" can involve physical exertion or movement, but it doesn't fit as a verb.

**Conclusion:**

We might need to reconsider our approach or look for another pattern. The words don't seem to form a clear group of four synonymous verbs. Let's try another pattern or re-evaluate the list for other potential verb synonyms. If you have any other ideas or want to try a different pattern, let me know!

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that are each homophones

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm potential homophones.

Step 2: Narrow down the list to only include puzzle words that are homophones.

Step 3: From the list of puzzle words that are homophones, try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that each have a common connection. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. 

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each homophones of names of animals: DEAR HAIR HOARSE WAIL
Puzzle words that are each homophones of Greek Letters: MOO NEW PIE ROW

If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over.

Example Input and Output:

Input:

Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: ANGEL, PIRATE, SPELL, WAIL, WITCH, HIVE, COMB,  WAX, DEAR, HAIR, HONEY,  HOARSE, PERIOD, STRETCH, WHILE, CLOWN

Output:

Let’s examine the list of words provided to see which ones are homophones, then narrow down the list to actual homophones, and then see if any are homophones based on a similar connection:

**Step 1: Identify Homophones**

For each word in the list, let’s say the word aloud to find out if it is a homophone

Angel - No homophone comes to mind

Pirate - No homophone comes to mind

Spell - No homophone comes to mind

Wail - Possible homophone “whale” like the sea animal

Witch - Possible homophone “which”

Hive - Possible homophone “I’ve”

Comb - Maybe a homphone of “come”

Wax - No homophone comes to mind

Dear - Possible homophone “deer”

Hair - Possible homophone “hare” or “here” or “hear”

Honey - No homophone comes to mind

Hoarse - Possible homophone “horse”

Period - No homophone comes to mind

Stretch - No homophone comes to mind

While - Possible homophone “wile” or “wild”

Clown - No homophone comes to mind

**Step 2: Narrow down list**

Wail - Possible homophone “whale” like the sea animal

Hive - Possible homophone “I’ve”

Comb - Maybe a homphone of “come”

Dear - Possible homophone “deer”

Hair - Possible homophone “hare” or “here” or “hear”

Hoarse - Possible homophone “horse”

While - Possible homophone “wile” or “wild”

**Step 3: Extract connection from list**

There does appear to be a common set of homophones here. The connection is “animal homophones” and the words are:

WAIL, DEAR, HAIR, HOARSE

— end of example input and output —


If you can’t find four words that follow the pattern, let us know and we’ll try another pattern.

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: SUE DEMI MARS MEAT PUSH-UP LADY PAYDAY CORE CRUNCH SPORTS THRUST WIRELESS SUBSTANCE DOVE EARLY BIG

## Output

Let's go through the steps to identify a possible solution to this puzzle.

**Step 1: Identify Homophones**

For each word in the list, let's say the word aloud to find out if it is a homophone:

- Sue - Possible homophone "sew"
- Demi - No homophone comes to mind
- Mars - Possible homophone "ma's" (informal for "mother's")
- Meat - Possible homophone "meet"
- Push-up - No homophone comes to mind
- Lady - No homophone comes to mind
- Payday - No homophone comes to mind
- Core - Possible homophone "corps"
- Crunch - No homophone comes to mind
- Sports - No homophone comes to mind
- Thrust - No homophone comes to mind
- Wireless - No homophone comes to mind
- Substance - No homophone comes to mind
- Dove - Possible homophone "dove" (past tense of dive)
- Early - No homophone comes to mind
- Big - No homophone comes to mind

**Step 2: Narrow down list**

- Sue - Possible homophone "sew"
- Mars - Possible homophone "ma's"
- Meat - Possible homophone "meet"
- Core - Possible homophone "corps"
- Dove - Possible homophone "dove" (past tense of dive)

**Step 3: Extract connection from list**

Let's see if there is a common connection among these homophones:

- Sue (sew) - related to sewing
- Mars (ma's) - informal possessive form
- Meat (meet) - related to gathering
- Core (corps) - related to a group or body
- Dove (dove) - related to birds or diving

Upon examining these, there doesn't seem to be a clear, unique connection among four of these words that fits a specific pattern like the examples given (e.g., animal names or Greek letters).

Since we couldn't find a group of four words with a clear connection, we might need to consider a different pattern or re-evaluate the list for other potential homophones. Let me know if you want to try another approach or if there's another pattern to consider.

Right now, we need options for possible guesses. Your task is to brainstorm possible combinations of four words that match this pattern.

Pattern: Puzzle words that each come after the same prefixes or words

Steps to take:

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm prefixes or words that can come before each puzzle word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular prefixes or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous prefixes or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that each come after “tele”: COMMUTE MEDICINE PROMPTER VISION
Puzzle words that each come after “deep”: CUT FAKE FREEZE SIX
Puzzle words that each come after “belly”: BUTTON DANCE FLOP LAUGH

Step 2: From your brainstorming notes, identify puzzle words that can have the same prefix or word come before them.

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can have that same prefix or word, trying to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each have the same prefix or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.

Example Input and Output:

Input: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: ABSURDITY PROGRESS NONSENSE ADVANCE MARCH SKUNK MADNESS PUSH CUT FREEZE FEET GARBAGE CHEESE FOLLY FAKE SIX

Output:

Let’s examine the list of puzzle words provided to see what prefixes or words come before these puzzle words, then identify puzzle words from the list that have the same prefixes or words that commonly come before them, then identify what other puzzle words could form this connection, then arrive at a conclusion.

**Step 1: Prefixes or words that commonly come before these puzzle words**

**ABSURDITY** - sheer, utter, complete

**PROGRESS** - steady, significant, slow

**NONSENSE** - complete, utter, sheer

**ADVANCE** - in, rapid, significant

**MARCH** - long, slow, annual

**SKUNK** - striped, little, dead

**MADNESS** - sheer, utter, pure

**PUSH** - final, gentle, big

**CUT** - deep, budget, price

**FREEZE** - deep, sudden, hard

**FEET** - bare, tired, sore

**GARBAGE** - household, kitchen, street

**CHEESE** - cheddar, blue, cream

**FOLLY** - sheer, utter, complete

**FAKE** - news, ID, tan

**SIX** - number, at, o'clock

**Step 2: Puzzle Words that have the same words that commonly come before them**

Sheer - Folly, Absurdity, Madness, Nonsense

Deep - Freeze, Cut

**Step 3: Other puzzle words that could form the connection of “deep”**

**ABSURDITY** - No

**PROGRESS** - No

**NONSENSE** - No

**ADVANCE** - No

**MARCH** - Maybe

**SKUNK** - No

**MADNESS** - No

**PUSH** - No

user: Let's brainstorm a possible solution to this puzzle: MEAT CORE PAYDAY DOVE MARS CRUNCH THRUST EARLY WIRELESS SUBSTANCE BIG LADY SUE PUSH-UP SPORTS DEMI

## Output

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. We need to find a group of four words from the list that are each one letter away from something else in common. 

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm words that are one letter away from each puzzle word.

Let's start by looking at each word and thinking of words that are one letter away:

1. MEAT: Meet, Seat, Beat, Heat
2. CORE: Bore, More, Sore, Lore
3. PAYDAY: Payday is a bit tricky, but let's try: Mayday, Payday (as in the candy bar)
4. DOVE: Love, Move, Rove
5. MARS: Cars, Bars, Wars
6. CRUNCH: Brunch, Crunchy
7. THRUST: Trust, Thrusts
8. EARLY: Yearly, Nearly
9. WIRELESS: Tireless, Wireless (as in the technology)
10. SUBSTANCE: Substance is long, but let's try: Substances, Substage
11. BIG: Bag, Bug, Bog
12. LADY: Lacy, Laddy
13. SUE: Use, Sub
14. PUSH-UP: Pushup is tricky, but let's try: Pushups, Push-up (as in the exercise)
15. SPORTS: Ports, Sorts
16. DEMI: Semi, Dime

Step 2: Identify a connection between the words that you’ve brainstormed that applies to multiple puzzle words.

Now, let's look for a common theme or connection among these brainstormed words. 

- MEAT (Meet), CORE (More), DOVE (Love), MARS (Cars): These words can be related to things you might find in a grocery store or market (Meat, More, Love as in Dove chocolate, Cars as in Mars bars).

Step 3: See if other puzzle words can share the connection.

Let's see if we can find a group of four words that fit this pattern:

- MEAT (Meet)
- CORE (More)
- DOVE (Love)
- MARS (Cars)

These words are each one letter away from words that can be associated with a grocery store or market. 

If this doesn't seem to fit, we can try another pattern or connection. Let me know if you think this is a viable solution or if we should explore other possibilities.
