Thanks for joining us. I’m sorry my team couldn’t explain more on the chopper before you got here. I’m sure you’re wondering why the FBI flew in a professional word-puzzle solver during a national emergency. It’s because we need your help. There’s no easy way to put this, but terrorists have planted a bomb inside a children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

We brought you in because you’ve got PhDs in linguistics, creative writing, and logic from Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. They say you’re the best at New York Times connections puzzles. For the sake of us all, I hope they’re right. You seem cool as a cucumber. Good. We needed someone who could keep their wits about them under pressure.

This puzzle is just like a New York Times connections puzzle. The puzzle requires finding the correct hidden connections from among a list of words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have something in common.

Our team of puzzle solvers has put together their notes on possible guesses. We need a fresh set of eyes on these options.

Step One: Look over those notes and consider the strength of each guess. 

For each guess, write down how well the guess conforms to the following features of strong guesses:

- As this is a New York Times puzzle, the connection between the four words is more subtle and more unique than simple connections like “5-letter word,” “Name” or “Verb” that could apply to many groups of words.
- The connection fits each of the four words equally well.
- The connection applies with the same level of specificity for each of the four words.
- Each of the four words has the same relationship to the connection. Look out for whether one word functions as a different part of speech than the other words as this often indicates a weak guess.

Step Two: Select your two top choices for guesses to submit.

Your two top choices should not have any words that overlap with each other, because that would indicate that one of the two guesses is wrong. 

Step Three: Determine which of your two top choices is strongest and select that one to submit.

Notes on possible guesses:

Guess: 
CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY
 Rationale: 
The words CRUNCH, DOVE, MARS, and PAYDAY are all names of candy bars. Each word can be followed by "bar" to form the name of a specific type of candy bar.
Guess: 
PAYDAY PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST
 Rationale: 
The words "PAYDAY," "PUSH-UP," "SPORTS," and "THRUST" are connected because each can commonly follow the word "BIG" to form phrases: "BIG PAYDAY," "BIG PUSH-UP," "BIG SPORTS," and "BIG THRUST." This connection is based on a common prefix pattern where the word "BIG" precedes each of these words to create familiar expressions.
Guess: 
CRUNCH MARS PAYDAY SPORTS
 Rationale: 
The words CRUNCH, PAYDAY, SPORTS, and MARS are all connected by the fact that they can be followed by the word "bar." Each of these words represents a type of candy or chocolate bar, or in the case of SPORTS, a place where people gather to watch sports.
Guess: 
DOVE MARS PAYDAY SPORTS
 Rationale: 
The words MARS, PAYDAY, DOVE, and SPORTS are all connected because they can each modify the word "BAR." This means that each word can precede "BAR" to form a common term or product name, such as "Mars Bar," "Payday Bar," "Dove Bar," and "Sports Bar."


Let’s think this through step by step. Share every thought that comes to mind. At the end, write down your top choice for a guess to submit. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.

## Output

Let's analyze the notes and the list of words to determine the best guesses for the puzzle.

### Step One: Evaluate Each Guess

1. **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**
   - **Connection**: Names of candy bars.
   - **Strength**: Strong. Each word is a well-known candy bar, and the connection is specific and unique.

2. **PAYDAY PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**
   - **Connection**: Can be preceded by "BIG."
   - **Strength**: Moderate. While "BIG" can precede each word, the connection is less unique and more generic.

3. **CRUNCH MARS PAYDAY SPORTS**
   - **Connection**: Can be followed by "bar."
   - **Strength**: Moderate. While CRUNCH, MARS, and PAYDAY are candy bars, SPORTS is more commonly associated with "sports bar," which is a different context.

4. **DOVE MARS PAYDAY SPORTS**
   - **Connection**: Can modify "BAR."
   - **Strength**: Moderate. Similar to the previous guess, but DOVE is a candy bar, and SPORTS is more of a venue type.

### Step Two: Select Two Top Choices

Based on the analysis, the two strongest guesses are:

- **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY**: Strong connection as candy bars.
- **PAYDAY PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**: Moderate connection with "BIG."

These two guesses do not overlap in terms of words, which is a good sign.

### Step Three: Determine the Strongest Choice

The strongest choice is **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY** because the connection is specific, unique, and applies equally to all four words as candy bars. The connection is more subtle and unique compared to the more generic "BIG" prefix.

### Final Decision

Submit **CRUNCH DOVE MARS PAYDAY** as the top choice for the puzzle. This guess has the strongest and most specific connection among the options provided.

Notes on possible guesses:

Guess: 
BIG CORE THRUST WIRELESS
 Rationale: 
The words "WIRELESS, BIG, THRUST, CORE" are connected through their association with technology and innovation. "Wireless" relates to wireless technology, "Big" can refer to big data or big tech, "Thrust" is linked to technological advancements or engineering, and "Core" pertains to core technology or components in tech.
Guess: 
CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST
 Rationale: 
The words CORE, MEAT, SUBSTANCE, and THRUST are connected as they can each be a noun meaning the essential part or essence of something. This connection is based on their synonymous nature as nouns representing the core or fundamental aspect of an object or concept.
Guess: 
CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST
 Rationale: 
The words "CORE," "PUSH-UP," "SPORTS," and "THRUST" are all connected through their association with exercise and physical activity. "Push-up" and "core" are specific exercises, "thrust" can refer to a movement in exercises, and "sports" encompasses a range of physical activities.
Guess: 
BIG DEMI LADY MEAT
 Rationale: 
Each word in the guess can be followed by another word to form a common compound word or phrase: "demi-god," "big-shot," "meat-ball," and "lady-bug." This connection involves words being followed by the same word or phrase, which is a typical pattern in word puzzles.

user: What is your top choice for a guess to submit for this puzzle? PUSH-UP BIG DEMI SPORTS SUBSTANCE SUE MEAT WIRELESS CORE EARLY LADY THRUST

## Output

Let's analyze each of the guesses provided in the notes and evaluate their strengths based on the criteria given:

1. **BIG CORE THRUST WIRELESS**
   - Connection: Technology and innovation.
   - Evaluation: The connection is somewhat broad and not equally specific for each word. "Wireless" fits well, but "Big" and "Thrust" are more loosely connected to technology. This guess seems weak because the connection isn't equally strong for all words.

2. **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**
   - Connection: Essential part or essence.
   - Evaluation: This connection is strong because each word can indeed represent the core or fundamental aspect of something. The connection is equally specific for each word, making this a strong guess.

3. **CORE PUSH-UP SPORTS THRUST**
   - Connection: Exercise and physical activity.
   - Evaluation: "Core," "Push-up," and "Thrust" fit well with exercise, but "Sports" is a broader category. The connection is not equally specific for all words, making this a weaker guess.

4. **BIG DEMI LADY MEAT**
   - Connection: Forming compound words or phrases.
   - Evaluation: Each word can indeed form a common compound word or phrase, and the connection is equally specific for each word. This is a strong guess.

Now, let's select the two top choices that do not overlap:

- **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**: Strong connection with no overlap with the other strong guess.
- **BIG DEMI LADY MEAT**: Strong connection with no overlap with the other strong guess.

Finally, determine which of these two is the strongest:

- **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**: This guess has a very clear and specific connection that applies equally to all words, making it the strongest choice.

Therefore, my top choice for a guess to submit is **CORE MEAT SUBSTANCE THRUST**.

Notes on possible guesses:

Guess: 
DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS WIRELESS
 Rationale: 
The words DEMI, PUSH-UP, SPORTS, and WIRELESS are all types of bras. Each word represents a different style or feature of a bra.
Guess: 
DEMI EARLY LADY SUE
 Rationale: 
The words "LADY," "SUE," "DEMI," and "EARLY" are connected by the concept of "name" or "title." "Lady" is a title, "Sue" and "Demi" are names, and "Early" can be a surname.
Guess: 
BIG DEMI LADY SUE
 Rationale: 
The words "BIG," "DEMI," "LADY," and "SUE" are connected through pop culture references. Each word can be associated with well-known figures or titles in entertainment, such as "Big" from "Big" the movie, "Demi" for Demi Lovato, "Lady" for Lady Gaga, and "Sue" for Sue Sylvester from "Glee."

user: What is your top choice for a guess to submit for this puzzle? LADY WIRELESS BIG DEMI EARLY SUE SPORTS PUSH-UP

## Output

Let's evaluate each of the guesses based on the criteria provided:

1. **DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS WIRELESS**: 
   - **Connection**: Types of bras.
   - **Strength**: This connection is quite specific and unique. Each word clearly represents a different style or feature of a bra. The connection fits each word equally well and with the same level of specificity. All words have the same relationship to the connection as they are all types of bras.

2. **DEMI EARLY LADY SUE**:
   - **Connection**: Names or titles.
   - **Strength**: This connection is weaker because "Early" as a surname is less common and not as specific as the other words. The connection is not equally strong for each word, and the level of specificity varies. "Lady" is a title, while "Sue" and "Demi" are more commonly first names, making the relationship to the connection inconsistent.

3. **BIG DEMI LADY SUE**:
   - **Connection**: Pop culture references.
   - **Strength**: This connection is somewhat subjective and relies on specific knowledge of pop culture. While each word can be associated with a figure or title, the connection is not as direct or specific as the first guess. The relationship to the connection varies, as "Big" refers to a movie, while the others refer to people.

Based on the analysis, the strongest guess is **DEMI PUSH-UP SPORTS WIRELESS**. This guess has a clear, specific, and unique connection that applies equally and consistently to all four words. Therefore, I would submit this guess.
