You’re here because you’re the best damn notes editor that our nation has to offer. Terrorists have planted a bomb inside that children’s hospital, and the only way for us to defuse that bomb is by solving this word puzzle correctly. If we fail, thousands of innocent children will die.

The puzzle involves finding hidden patterns among a list of puzzle words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have some kind of hidden connection with each other.

Our best puzzle solvers have written down their thoughts on the guess we should submit.

Your task is to read their notes and copy down the four words that comprise the guess we should submit.

Do not copy down a guess that we already know was incorrect.

 

Notes about the top choice for submitting a guess:

Based on the analysis provided, the strongest potential connection identified is between the words **WIRELESS, BIG, THRUST, CORE**. These words seem to have a cohesive connection related to technology and innovation, which aligns with the patterns typically found in New York Times connections puzzles.

However, before submitting this guess, let's quickly reassess:

1. **WIRELESS, BIG, THRUST, CORE**: 
   - "Wireless" could relate to wireless technology.
   - "Big" could relate to "big data" or "big tech."
   - "Thrust" could relate to technological advancements or engineering.
   - "Core" could relate to core technology or core components in tech.

This connection seems plausible, as it fits the pattern of words relating to technology and innovation. 

Given the options and the analysis, it seems reasonable to submit **WIRELESS, BIG, THRUST, CORE** as a guess. It is the most cohesive and specific connection identified from the notes provided.

Therefore, I recommend submitting this guess. If it turns out to be incorrect, we can then go back to brainstorming other possible connections./n *** /n

Your response needs to be in a particular format. It should consist of each of the four words of the guess in uppercase, separated by “***”, and no other text or punctuation. Good luck, godspeed, and God bless America. We’re all counting on you.
