Step 2: See if other puzzle words can connect to different meanings of the same word or letter. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that each connect to different meanings of the same word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular connections are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous connections. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that each connect to different meanings of the same word, start over at Step 1.
