Pattern: Puzzle words that each share the same unique characteristic. For this pattern, the connection is with how the puzzle words are structured or how the words sound, not with what the words mean.

Steps to take:

Step 1: Say different puzzle words aloud and try to identify two puzzle words that share a unique characteristic related to how the word is structured or sounds. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular characteristics are more likely to be the correct connection than generic and ubiquitous characteristics. Think outside the box.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each heteronyms: BASS DOVE DESERT WIND
Puzzle words that are each letter spellings: BEE EX GEE JAY
Puzzle words that are each two letters + number: CANINE FREIGHT OFTEN STONE
Puzzle words that are each examples of onomatopoeia: BANG PLOP SPLASH THUD
Puzzle words that are each ”-ough” words that don’t rhyme: BOUGH COUGH DOUGH TOUGH
Puzzle words that are each words you say twice in a row: BOO POM TOM YO
Puzzle words that are each palindromes: BIB EYE GAG POP

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can have that same characteristic. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Try saying each puzzle word aloud to hear if the linguistic characteristic is present. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four words, start over at Step 1.
