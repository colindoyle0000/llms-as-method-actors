Step 2: See if other puzzle words are also a way to do that same thing. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, particular things are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous things. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each a way to do the same thing, start over at Step 1.
