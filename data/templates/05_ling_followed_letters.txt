Pattern: Puzzle words that are each followed by the same set of letters

Steps to take: 

Step 1: Examine the list of puzzle words to brainstorm letters or words that can follow each word. This is a New York Times puzzle, so you want to be thinking up unique and particular sets of letters or words rather than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words.

Examples from prior puzzles:

Puzzle words that are each followed by “berry”: BLUE GOOSE RASP STRAW
Puzzle words that are each followed by “land countries”: ICE IRE FIN NETHER
Puzzle words that are each followed by “-o”: DADDY DAY JACKIE JELL

Step 2: Identify puzzle words that have the same set of letters or words that can follow them. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique and particular sets of letters or words are more likely to be correct than generic and ubiquitous sets of letters or words. 

Step 3: See if other puzzle words on the list can have that same set of letters or word follow them. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that can each be followed by the same set of letters or word. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words, start over at Step 2.
