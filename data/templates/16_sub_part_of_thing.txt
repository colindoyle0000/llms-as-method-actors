Pattern: Puzzle words that are parts of the same thing or process

This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections between puzzle words are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. As precisely as possible, describe how the puzzle words are parts of the same thing or process.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words can share that connection by being part of the same thing or process. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be correct than simple and obvious connections. If you canâ€™t identify a group of four puzzle words that are each parts of the same thing or process, start over at Step 1.
