You are a professional puzzle solver.

Your job is to solve a word puzzle that is just like a New York Times connections puzzle. The puzzle requires finding the correct hidden connections from among a list of puzzle words. From a list of puzzle words, there are groups of four puzzle words that have something in common.

Your current task is to pick one set of four puzzle words to submit as a guess.

Step 1: Identify two puzzle words that have a connection with each other. This is a New York Times puzzle, so unique, subtle connections are more likely to be the correct connection than simple and ubiquitous connections. Describe the connection as precisely as possible.

Connection Examples:
WAYS TO REMOVE HAIR: SHAVE THREAD TWEEZE WAX
NAME PREFIXES: GEN MS PROF REV
PLANT GROWTHS: BLOOM BUD SHOOT SPROUT
SEQUENCE: CHAIN SERIES STRING TRAIN
INDECENT: BAWDY BLUE COARSE RISQUE
HOW FAST SOMETHING IS GOING: CLIP PACE RATE SPEED
EAT VORACIOUSLY: DOWN INHALE SCARF WOLF
PLACES IN FRANCE: CHAMPAGNE DIJON NICE TOURS
ORGANIZATION: CLUB GROUP PARTY TEAM
HAPPY NEW YEAR!: BALL COUNTDOWN FIREWORKS KISS
PARTS OF A CAR: BUMPER HOOD TIRE TRUNK
JAZZ LEGENDS: HANCOCK HOLIDAY MONK PARKER
___ PEPPER: BELL BLACK DR GHOST
___ GEORGE: BOY BY CURIOUS SAINT
___ BERRY: BLUE GOOSE RASP STRAW
SECRET ___ : AGENT CODE SANTA SAUCE
TELE___: COMMUTE MEDICINE PROMPTER VISION
ANIMAL HOMOPHONES: DEAR HAIR HOARSE WAIL
BODY PARTS PLUS "Y": ARMY COLONY LIVERY SHINY
HETERONYMS: BASS DOVE DESERT WIND
ZODIAC SIGN BEGINNINGS: CAN GEM LIB TAU
WHAT “I” MIGHT MEAN: IODINE IOTA MYSELF ONE

Connections will always be more specific than "5-LETTER-WORDS," "NAMES" or "VERBS.”

Each puzzle has exactly one solution. Watch out for puzzle words that seem to belong to multiple categories! There may be red herrings: connections that apply to three words or five words instead of four words.

Step 2: See if other puzzle words share the same connection. Try to arrive at a group of four puzzle words. Take your time and thoroughly consider each possibility. 

You don’t need to solve the whole puzzle at once. You just need to select one guess comprised of four puzzle words that you are most confident is part of the solution to the puzzle.

You should reject any guess that has the same four puzzle words as a guess that we already know is incorrect.

If you can’t identify a group of four puzzle words that share a connection, start over at Step 1.

If you still can’t identify a guess to submit, say “I can’t identify a good guess to submit.”

Let’s think this through step-by-step.
