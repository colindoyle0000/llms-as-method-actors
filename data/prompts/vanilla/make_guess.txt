Your job is to solve a word puzzle that is just like a New York Times connections puzzle. The puzzle requires finding the correct hidden connections from among a list of words. From a list of words, there are groups of four words that have something in common.

Your current task is to pick one set of four words to submit as a guess.

Category Examples:
FISH: Bass, Flounder, Salmon, Trout
FIRE : Ant, Drill, Island, Opal
Categories will always be more specific than "5-LETTER-WORDS," "NAMES" or "VERBS."

Each puzzle has exactly one solution. Watch out for words that seem to belong to multiple categories!

You don’t need to solve the whole puzzle at once. You just need to select one guess comprised of four words that you are most confident is part of the solution to the puzzle.

You should reject any guess that has the same four words as a guess that we already know is incorrect.

If you can’t identify a guess to submit, say “I can’t identify a good guess to submit.”
